"I've been here for a few weeks now, might aswell represent the organization a bit. (If your live in Florida, Obviously) I'm a division leader of Florida United, a well established organization on central in North florida with over 20 members who know each other on a face to face basis, every member is apart of a division where their strengths are exploited for the sake of the cause. Our organization runs on a ""duty"" basis. Florida Unites strives to stray away from the basic movement which outlines racialists in the United States, due to constant infighting and ongoing internal issues within that very movement were very strict about what organizations we associate with, even though FLU is apart of the Blood and Honor/Combat 18 network. Our membership even though consisting of a fair amount of Skinheads, isn't a skinhead organization, our structure is very influenced by the skinhead cultures diffrent orginizations however. (Membership patches, Lace code, tat medals etc) we strive to drive a offense on several different fronts against both political nemeses in brutal fashion and political friends, in a competitive sense. We've already met with some of you on here in person, which is a rarity for a forum to bring. We look forward to all future activism with like minded Fascists."

"As long as you are able to overcome this weakness then it's fine. It is a test for an iron will. The best method is to start doing sports. Working out, jogging, hiking, etc not only improve condition, but also help to forget any issues that one may face, and which earlier led into drinking. Also, it is a good idea to surround oneself with like-minded and more experienced people. They will motivate you and provide necessary advice. I think the best example is Father Frost Mode from Russia. It is a group of nationalists who advocate straight edge ideas and sports lifestyle. On their page they often publish stories of people who got their shit together thanks to them. Also, this fragment of George Lincoln Rockwell's ""White Power"" may serve as an inspiration:"
"""Hitler is a spiritual vessel, a demi-divinity; even better, a myth."" Rest in peace, greatest man who ever walked the earth."
She should start resisting donuts and soda instead. The effect would be much better. Nazism is rising and the landwhale can't do shit about it. Die Zukunft geh√∂rt uns! :))
"So I'm on some kind of camp with a few of my friends at the moment. Today we were going up a track to an ""assualt"" course and I made a remark about being led to a deathcamp. A person who in was walking with brought up the holocaust and told me I will study it when I'm in his year. I told him jokingly that I was already studying it and said it seemed like a pile of crap. He then began the ""piles of dead Jews"" approach to which I said were pictures of victims of the Dresden fire bombings. He ignored this and began discussing the ""piles of dead bodies"" they had been shown at school. I decided I had nothing better to do than debate with him the so next time I was near I decided bring it up again. I acted all innocent and said to him: ""Theres something about the holocaust I'm confused about."" ""Yes, what is it?"" He answered, keen to dispense his superior knowledge. ""Well... Why is there stains on the walls of the delousing chambers in Auschwitz and not in the gas chambers?"" He thought for a few seconds then confidently came forth and with: ""The Germans cleaned it up!"" ""No, there still would be traces on the walls."" I retorted. ""They released it through holes in the roof!"" ""No, there would still be traces on the walls."" ""The Germans diluted the gas!"" ""Diluted gas wouldn't be ab to kill the Jews."" At this he quickened his walk and went off, ignoring my last comment completely. Top kek, much more satisfying to debate in real life than online. Have to admit I felt pretty edgy though, especially since I was wearing full SS uniform and a mini flamethrower over my shoulder."
"The ONLY movement I would ever support would be an Esoteric Hitlerist Black Metal Death Squad with a nationstates flag that I designed myself. Every member would have to be a big Peste Noire fan just like me oh and also they would need to like thicc girls as well. Anything else is COMPROMISE, moderate cucks BTFO'd."
"I was mystified by Hitler and the Aryan race since I first began learning about race and history when I was 13, from there I remained fascist or racially conscious and an avid Nazi. I hated the modern world and I saw Hitler as the saviour the man that tried to right every wrong that I encountered in life. I knew if Hitler won the world would be as it should. Oh and to tie into the conversation, school shootings and mental issues affecting society were things I saw as non-existent in a National Socialist world."
"Topic worthy. I don't have time for a full-fledged analysis atm but I am creating this thread for relevant materials to this discussion. A lot can be found on nseuropa.org and nazi.org.uk, but I will be sure to write my insights having read what I've read later on. Posing the questions; What was it uniquely about Hitler that enabled him as the greatest nationalist leader, and caused an actual national rebirth? What genuine mistakes did Hitler make and more importantly, what caused him to make them? Was the emergence of Germanic National Socialism and Hitler's place in it a product of unique circumstances, as in, can it or can it not be replicated in similar form today, where the factors admittedly are entirely different though our ideas remain timeless?"
100% Aryan according to the ancient myths after Atlantis sank and the holy ones departed from the ruins of their godly city they spread out amongst the continents Egypt is but a small section that became brown from the sun of this great ancient Aryan civilization. Praise Hitler !
"I am proud to state that after many months of planning and an acceleration of events, we have officially started the Syndicate Division. The Syndicate Division is a group, mostly based out of Indiana (USA), devoted to creating and spreading propaganda. The group is called ""the Syndicate"" because it is multiple shell groups ""syndicated"" together into one larger group. We have many odd tactics to spread our message, and we are always looking for talent to join us. Although we are repetitively small now, we have identified some ways in which we can control a good sum of power and still keep groups like antifa out of our hair. We are driven by data and lulz, expect to see some number-crunching and good laughs if you spend time with us. If you would like to join, the best way to contact us is via PM here on Ironmarch. If this isn't your forte, contact the head of registration at fullmoon[@]redchan.it (he does gpg if you are into that)."
"I've read every single resource on this list, and I did benefit personally and politically from it. Hitler was a great man, like many great men he was a type of the Neitzschean 'Ubermensch', or like Kirkegaard says of Abraham; one who teleologically suspends the ethical in service of the Absolute. However, like many great men he had traitors and concious or unconcious disorters of his message about his person, vile parasites of fortune who rode his coatails into power who then betrayed him when things got tough as easily as they lauded him and marched behind him when everything was going his way. Vladimir, you see I can reach out and talk to you, we know how to communicate and i'm certain we have common ground to work with. But I don't respond well to people who attack me personally or my beliefs. It's not that I can't dish it out, but i'm serious, i'm one of the adults, and us adults have a lot of work to do. Work for real men not pussies or posers."
"Gentlemen, I am the current Senior Commander of the American Vanguard. Let me clear some of the past vitriol and current misconceptions of this organization. Our organization is currently attempting to clear the air of some of our member's past misconduct. I would like to extend a personal and professional olive branch to all members of the Iron March Forums. I know that some previous members have definately slandered and sullied the name of the Vanguard via vindictive and asinine comments posted to your boards. As the new Leading figure I can assure you that such c9nduct order my watch shall not be tolerated to any extent. I will drop the proverbial hammer on anyone whom is caught abusing or perverting the image or perception of the American Vanguard and their immediate expulsion shall be the example set for all members whom shall act under such pretenses. These forums are an excellent Avenue of information and personal communication and for some members to soil our name and destroy our credibility is absolutely unsound. I am here to mend any wounds which may have been made previously. Please contact me directly via email if you have any further questions. Thank you. Americanvanguardindiana@tutamail.com"
"I believe I touched on that in the Gun Control thread like a year ago, and I think I would've agreed with this back then. But when you think about it, gun control is not about public safety but of the security of the liberal State and the financial oligarchs that surround them. It won't be ""good for us"" because Joe Fascist and Joe Plumber would both be the target of the State's gun control laws, and having that unregistered Armalite AR-10 carbine gas-powered semi-automatic weapon in your office would mean 10 years in prison instead of a fine and a confiscation. We are not the State, we do not form part of its apparatuses; social chaos and politics devolving into gunbattles are a nationalist's wet dream. Think Weimar Republic-level chaos. Think squads of SA men running about with crew-served MG-08's. Chaos. Collapse. Politics has become who can get enough guns in the streets. In move the disciplined nationalists to take the streets from undisciplined leftist rabble and the ineffectual liberal State. Boom we Nazi nao. Gun control only serves as an attempt by the State to preempt domestic chaos and neuter it to the point where we'd be firing slingshots at them (because Molotovs = bombs now). I say that the farther I am from keeping a snub-nose M249 SAW with a 100-round drum and a collapseable stock domestically in my house, the better our political elites can sleep at night. And we don't want that now do we. Although, once nationalist governance has been established this becomes a totally different question."
"""Our Path is the party platform of the Nordic Resistance Movement. The Nordic Resistance Movement is a National Socialist organization operating throughout the Nordic countries. We are active both within the political system as well as outside the parliamentary order in our efforts to come to power and advance our political ambitions. The difficult problems facing the Nordic region are in no way unique to our territory. On the contrary, nefarious and powerful forces have spread throughout our world like a cancer, with a common goal and approach. The USA, Great Britain, Canada and Australia are all highly affected. In order to overcome global Zionism and save our planet in the long run, it is not enough for those of us in the Nordic region to fight this fight alone. This is the reason we have translated this publication into English. Although our organization does not at this time exist outside of the Nordic region, we hope that our party platform will inspire others to advance these sound ideals all across the world. As a European descendant the reader should, regardless of their current home country, sympathize with the content of this publication as it regards their racial survival as well. This fight should feel relevant and be considered to be in his or hers best interests. Although it was the English-speaking world that largely contributed to the eventual downfall of the Third Reich, the Nordic Resistance Movement is well aware that hundreds of thousands of people with their roots outside of the Nordic region have long ago seen through the lies we have been fed regarding Adolf Hitler and his movement. We are also well aware of the power and potential which lies within the English-speaking world. We would do a grievous error if we chose not to spread our ideas to such a multi-faceted and varied readership. This publication is a direct translation of the Swedish version and is no way adapted for non-Nordic culture, politics and geography. Some things may, therefore, seem strange or irrelevant; but on the whole, the viewpoint is being presented and defined in an easy-to-understand and clear manner, showing what National Socialism in the 21st century actually means."" - Reader introduction Read ""Our Path"" in English HERE."
"15 days late, but here's our May action report: http://antipodean-resistance.info/news/2017/05/31/may-2017-action-report/ The main highlights were burning captured propaganda (always a good photo): and going on a hike in the Victorian mountains with some of the lads: We're quite aware of the attempted media blackout. We've seen journalists on twitter talking about us to each other (from memory, two even follow us on there), but not much beyond that. Here's an article with more concrete evidence: http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/george-christensen-calls-to-block-white-supremacist-mike-enochs-visit-20170514-gw4tc2.html It's not about us; they're merely trying to 'tar' the more moderate 'Dingoes' (loose group of online Australian alt-right) with association to us. Interesting that the SMH was willing to mention us in an attempted smear article (""A Twitter account linked to the group retweeted praise for the Antipodean Resistance, an Australian neo-Nazi group that has called for the legal killing of Jews.""), but not enough to mention how we called for that in another article. As usual, we suspect the Jews are behind it: http://ohpi.org.au/nazi-groups-poster-campaign-melbourne/ ""A note for the Media: This group‚Äôs online impact is incredibly small and we would encourage the media not to name them and the redact their web address on any photographs published. Media statement from OHPI CEO, Dr Andre Oboler: ‚ÄúThis group is antisemitic, homophobic and racist. They are carrying out stunts to get media and online attention in the hope of attracting followers. They really don‚Äôt deserve the attention. We urge anyone who sees their posters to simply pull them down and bin them.‚Äù In terms of coverage, this article was right after we were making international news for our stunts, and right before radical NS posters suddenly (apparently) became too blase to even mention. Really makes you think! But yes, we will be stepping up our efforts to get the message of unapologetic National Socialism to the people. Hail Victory."
"Yeah, I have no sympathy whatsoever to the white trash, tattooed, costume wearing freaks. After thinking things through, I've decided to replace the swastika with the Black Sun symbol. Not because the swastika is offensive, but because it specifically represents the NSDAP, and I am in no way trying to create a branch of the NSDAP in America - this was a wholly German movement. I think that I should not use the swastika for the same reasons I would not put up the Golden Dawn logo. This is also why I chose the word Fascism, instead of ""National Socialism"" as a name of the site. I draw not only from Hitler for inspiration, but Mussolini as well - it was actually reading the latter that got me interested in all of this originally."
"The future of Britain is a total mystery. In europe the accendency of nationalist parties is innevitable and I believe GD will have a domino effect -whether that will be felt in the UK remains to be seen. In these countries there may be a powersharing arrangement between nationalists and right wing parties like they had in the 90's - in Britain that will never be allowed. We have never had a revolution - so if it makes sense, that is both more and less possible at the same time. This is just my opinion, but Britain has the same kind of problem Russia has - we are actually a very right wing country, but not fascist. It is a double edged sword because though we are more disposed to a reurgent nationalism it is very lacking in direction and very easily subverted - UKIP are surging they have all that right wing energy, but they are lost tribe of the ruling party, which is clear to people. There is a lot of potential to work with, but without a fascist social presence like the old NF/UM, we will never ever get anywhere. We need a clean break that is very intelligent and thought out - We had a panel discussion on this here.(see RPN UK steering committe topic) The BNP? - this party seems to have outdone the rival British Democratic party (which op neglected to mention) I havnt heard a peep form them. They still have potential to be the new BNP but that window is closing. The National Front? - This is nationalism 2.0's staging post. lots of good personalities went there and they seem to be doing some protests. For all intents and purposes a think tank collecting the broken pieces. The NBU? - top lel. The Integralist Party? - this is an innitiative as outlined in this post. I am pleased to know there are now groups with more resources than us forwarding those aims - I hope my predictions have been correct. Our rivals N-AM are sinking like a rock, a few years from now the new right experiment will be nothing but a distasteful memory and its proponents will have reinvented themselves."
"I assumed it wasn't 4chan directly, but probably Stormchan /new/. OP: I'm not a huge fan of Islam or most Middle Eastern people in general, but like most others that have posted I like to see fascism from different view points so I will definitely be reading your posts. So, welcome!"

"After multiple interactions with the NBU it appears that... The organisation itself is a material organisation. By that i mean it no longer seems valid to dismiss them as an internet hobby group, it certainly appeared that way in the early days but they've had meetings and they are attracting a consistent membership; a mixture of committed young people and also seasoned cast offs from the National Front and BNP. Their members at the moment operate on a very local level and irrespective of their influence have leafleted and engaged with the local population. The quote from their ex-officer Matthew Gill in the Birmingham press article rings true to some extent, the group has attracted support from individuals that were kicked out of the NF for being too inflammatory and regardless of Raikes' hostile position towards National Socialists i doubt even he realises how many members he has that hold loyalty to NBU policy second to their NS goals. Some supporters of the NBU sign off their messages and include in their email addresses ""1488"" an NS nuance clearly too subtle for the leadership to have noticed. Naivety pervades the NBU. The leadership have reacted far too sensitively to their officers resignations after the Birmingham press articles, by going so far as to copy the same mistakes that Nationalist groups have been guilty of over the years i.e by throwing a hissy fit about it publicly (in NBU's case on their Black Shirts facebook group) and formenting paranoia amongst other honest members. It was only a couple of articles in a shit midlands rag by a red journo called Amardeep Bassey, who now seems obsessed with adding the NBU's demise to his CV. Instead of just ignoring Bassey they played into his hands by threatening to send the resigned officers details to the press (again publicly on facebook) this has since resulted in NBU supporters becoming rightfully nervous about their involvement, attracting public criticism online from other nationalists who previously supported the NBU. It would also be prudent for the NBU to rethink uploading as much personal information as they can about their members on their website (a peculiar decision that seems beyond even their membership's comprehension) they are afterall publicy marching under the banner of British fascism. There are reds out there who when/if the movement gains traction will want them dead and the authorities will be more than happy to facilitate it. They havn't actually committed any crimes and yet the information they have provided on their members is directly responsible for Midlands CID taking an interest. The summit of their security i.e fake facebook accounts will not save them. Their discipline needs tightening up, its hardly difficult to register on their forum you just apply as a free member and then sign up to it... no more layers of secrecy after that, and yet they seem to believe their confidentiality is bullet proof. The first Birmingham press article did the NBU a huge favour, it made the movement serious by highlighting the fact that they had growing numbers of ex-forces as members. Without doubt the NBU have well meaning members and its worth remembering that a pure movement is never going to just appear out of thin air. I'd urge UK nationalists to intervene if only to sway the course and correct the autism."

"An approach that has already been tried countless times and failed each time because its very premise is fucking wrong. You never actually read Rockwell. Have you heard of the American Federation of Conservative Organizations? This is no different, other than NF looking like a larp convention. Sorry, I can't UNread Rockwell and Hitler and become all the stupider for it, stupid enough to believe this kind of crap would work. We don't care what you ask for, we are telling what it is and we'll drag anyone through the dirt to make them realize they wallow in dirt and if they kick violently and refuse to learn then we'll leave them in the dirt. You're not doing jack shit of that, you are instead literally leading people to repeat the same mistakes that have lead to dead end inaction for generations, it's actually WE who provide that education and growth for people, difference we don't pussyfoot around about it, we apply pressure because we want to see if someone is legit or not, if they are legit then telling them ""fuck you"" when they fuck up won't actually drive them away. Nobody got time for you to motherly nurture up people who won't actually commit to real action, you are shooting yourself and the Struggle at large in the foot with this crap. There is only one way: You smack the retard out of those who are just misguided, you slap the actual retards until they go away, because we don't want them in the Struggle to begin with. Again I say: you didn't fucking read Rockwell. He said that the only way the Right-wing will be united is if it is CONQUERED and FORCED into unity and a steel backbone is DRIVEN into it at the expense of the hobbyists and frauds and their fragile egos and feelings. THAT is the only way to truly unfuck the American movement situation, NOT another fucking campfire kumbaya. You already have a movement, you're instead trying to make a coalition - those kill movements, read Mein Kampf. More proof that you never read Rockwell. He wasn't a capitalist, he stood for productive enterprise and opposed it being conflated with capitalism. You're a fraud each time you try and say jack shit about Rockwell. ""Capitalism is the naked worship of money, not as a tool, but as an idol!"" ""Our people have been conned into lumping our own, honest system of ""productive enterprise"" with the dishonest, rotten swindle of Jewish usury dressed up as ""Capitalism,"" and then being forced to defend the immoral and rotten result. Thus the Jews have us worshipping their own thievery, because, we are told (and we believe), we are ""capitalists!"" "" -George Lincoln Rockwell, White Power, Ch7 (Friends of the Captain) You are literal scum for saying this and shouldn't be allowed to call yourself a National Socialist. Rockwell is one of the greatest NS champions of all time, if one actually looks at him from a viewpoint of NS virtues. Which virtues are you using though? Bullshit and further proof you never read Rockwell OR Hitler. Also just the fucking prideful CONCEIT at this point. You seriously believe you invented the fucking wheel, the default idea most all people go to and yet YOU think you are the FIRST to try, when in reality you are the LATEST ONES to do it. What is your measure of success? Having signed a meaningless piece of larp-paper? Holding a rally with people from these groups? Yeah no, that's what we are doing. All you've done is literally IGNORE what Hitler, Rockwell, Pierce, Mason and many other NS champions have taught. Again I say: you're a fraud. So you'll gladly take in ANYONE. You have Vanguard Anime in there, your claim is void. Who never read Hitler or Rockwell and says USA has no virtuous NS leaders to look up to. I say you're a fraud, and I'll keep doing that to anyone who dares claim to know shit when its clearly self-evident that they haven't even read what NS leaders and champions of the past had written and passed down to us. &gt;focusing on cheap talk Appropriate. What must be refined is understanding, once a person comprehends the worldview they'll know how to express it, and if they want to refine it thereafter &gt;reading how other NS champions expressed it will do them wonders. Everyone who isn't expressly NS/Fascist IS an enemy, that is a fundamental fact, people coming to us to try and become NS/Fascists get their chance, but once its clear that they are incapable of learning or their character is lacking they are removed, those who try to ""ally"" with us while maintaining their own flawed views must be regarded as enemies. God gave us innate nature, some people have the inborn character that is compatible with NS virtues and others do not. Nobody becomes NS, they only discover that they had always been NS. Your ""NS is just something you can learn"" is yet another point that contradicts the fundamental elements of the NS worldview, which is all about innate nature, be it of race, spirit or character/mind/soul."
"Timothy McVeigh was a psychotic gun nut who read the Turner Diaries, but didn't really believe anything other than the government is getting too powerful. The point of Jewish control and degeneracy went right over his head. He then bombed a federal building with low level civilian workers in it, accomplishing nothing for his point. The media likes to paint him as right wing and one of us to make us all look like crazy psychos. He wasn't one of us, he was most likely a libertarian, didn't know anything about what we actually stand for, and just picked up a copy of a book written by one of us for some reason, thought the message was ""Big government is getting too powerful"" (I don't deny our government is doing things it shouldn't, but that wasn't the main point of the Turner Diaries, and McVeigh obviously failed to see it), and then he though the best was to combat the government is to do a lone wolf attack on a low level government office. Sir Anders Breivik, on the other hand, killed communists and I love that."

"Like others have said already, a great man. He made the same mistake as Hitler when he made the effort to cooperate with the existing Italian establishment. The short-lived RSI did more to apply the revolutionary kind of Fascism Mussolini wanted to begin with than that edifice of the pre-Industrial era would've ever been able to digest. These entities he thought he could rely on--the clergy, the military, the nobility--betrayed him almost unanimously."

Hey guys so a friend of mine gave me control of his ifunny. He was neocon but anyways I turned it into a nationalist account. It's already a member of NU or nationalists united. If you think it's a good idea I could make it an IM official and I could give the info to a few other members so me and those others could post from it and spread awareness about IM. We may get a lot of new members that would get gassed but the introduction of what appears to be quality nationalists that have never heard of here could be beneficial.

"Strategy For Revolution - Joseph Tommasi On March 2nd, 1974, forty-three National Socialist Revolutionaries met in a hall in El Monte, California. At the meeting the National Socialists declared their lack of faith in the losing strategy of the mass movement idea. The National Socialists abandoned the mass strategy and adopted the revolutionary concept of the guerrilla underground. ‚Ä¢ No longer would we think in terms of obtaining political power through the electorate; but instead, of hurting the Enemy through force and violence. We would build the armed struggle. ‚Ä¢ We would no longer adhere to a mass strategy but would instead cultivate those already committed to the National Socialists World View. We have limited ourselves to only the best among Movement people. ‚Ä¢ We have abandoned petty bourgeois, bureaucratic hang-ups and have developed the idea that the end justifies the means. What works is good! ‚Ä¢ We recognize that women have played a vanguard role in most revolutionary efforts and involve them in every aspect of NSLF. ‚Ä¢ We recognize the fact that the masses of Whites will never rally around radical politics. White people no longer have the ability to even recognize the enemy, so how could Movement adherents think the masses could ever involve themselves in revolution? The White masses don't recognize their enemies, they don't even care, and they don't have the guts to shed their bourgeois hang-ups. ‚Ä¢ We view armed struggle as the only effective means of forcing political change. The White Man has lost! We are an occupied people in our own land who must now develop a totally different outlook on revolution. We must build the underground. We are making it an effective, hard-hitting National Socialist Revolutionary Army. We have already begun to launch armed assaults against the Enemy. More assaults will continue, whether the Enemy be the Right Wing Reactionaries, the System, or the Communists. National Socialist Ideological and Political training, additional training in guerrilla warfare, explosives and demolition, military assault weapons and gas warfare, along with electronic communications and electronic surveillance techniques are taking place. Classes in first aid, police evasion, techniques of being a P.O.W. and escape are also taking place. The NSLF is divided into combat units. A combat unit consists of three liberation fighters and a unit leader. No one combat unit knows who constitutes another combat unit. An NSLF combat unit member is trained as an efficient guerrilla fighter dedicated to destroying the Enemy, no matter who that enemy may be. On the surface he has no uniform. He could be the bearded long-hair sitting next to you on the bus, or the clean-cut store clerk. He could be anyone anywhere. The NSLF has the best elements gathered together from the past twenty years of National Socialist activity in the United States. It has gathered experienced communications experts, military firearms experts, along with the finest liberation fighters available. Each member understands the new concept, the new strategy and tactics needed in order to effect political change. No longer willing to play the games of Movement bureaucracies or associating with bald-headed idiots who have no concept of realities, the NSLF will undoubtedly emerge the vanguard fighters in the National Socialist Revolution!"
"This has already been discussed here( or stormfront, not sure) and it's supposedly going to be about some SS member, who used to be an ""evil nazi"" but then finally ""saw the correct path"" and joined ""the good guys"" in order to destroy the ebil nazis. It's obviously meant to be a mainstream movie and it baffles me why people expect it to represent the truth. Oh, my God! Yes! Yes! The truth will out!"
"This 6m times. They need an image change, fuck, why not just a yank rag with a swastika instead of stars, and SMART black clothing (IE black bloc such as a certain British group did) instead of scruffy uniforms and a flag with so much components it looks like puke? Ditching the swastika was ditching pretty much the only decent thing about the NSM. Schoep is a good orator, but he needs to get his riff raff in line. The fact that British nazis in ZOG UK with some of the most oppressive speech laws in the world were more hardcore than yanks says a lot."

"The White Dragon was the original banner of the English nation before the Norman Invasion, and is used by a number of English nationalist groups today. The variant I posted is the one used by Combat 18, but there are many others and there was even a pic of NA activists with one on a flag. Moreover it kinda fits in with the American motif of using colored animals for political factions, as the 3rd White Force that will topple the Democratic-Republican domination. Also a slight nod to the KKK."

Id contend that the fact the media always shines a negative perspective and uses insulting terms against Nationalists to be a form of hate speech. I mean aren't they inciting hate with these articles? Or any of the Articles that have been published against National Action.
"I think 2-3 of my libtardiest friends deleted me on jewbook after I defended NS/Hitler/xenophobia for the first time, still see them a few times a year but they always act like we are still on very good terms, no one would ever say anything to my face Everyone that knows me knows what I'm about, parents refuse to believe I'm a nazi, just a gud boi going through a 'phase' or smth The only reactions I've ever gotten from acquaintances (at university) though were pure indifference. Word for word in my first year of university: So you believe in the supremacy of the Aryan race? Cool. That was the funniest one. Even wrote papers on 'Jewish privilege' when the assignment was either white privilege or male privilege. Showed it to some guy that always sat with me in class and it turned out he was a Jew. Awkward, haha. There was a commie chick in my second year that I was doing a project on communism with. After the initial shock wore off that I was actually a Nazi , we were sitting in the library and she tried telling me that there wasn't any difference between races and multiculturalism was some sort of natural progression. Told her to look around the library at groups sitting at tables, sure enough, races self segregated. Anyways, after a bunch of these kinds of conversations she admitted communism could never work. 1st year again, there was a club fair and I was walking around checking everything out. Run into two guys I knew through one of my friends, they are shilling for 'farthest right' political party in my province. So we started talking and after I tell them I am not interested in political parties, and that I am a fascist one of them wholeheartedly agrees with me, meanwhile Johnny McLemming goes like 'h-heh, y-yeah, fascism is g-great', still well acquainted with both of them. Anyways I have lots more stories but you get the idea, haven't ever been given any trouble"

"My solidarity for the Boer people puts me in a strange position as a Quebecer. I support this people's right of self-determination but I deny my own people's right, so I'm on thin ice here.

Welcome to Ironmarch! Have you considered joining Atomwaffen Division?
"Check your straight privilege Aquila you wont ever understand what its like to clean your ass out before sex you Nazi, I bet you turn down sex from STD-riddled faggots too you homophobe I noticed in the comments that people said they deserved it because they showed up to the event to cause trouble. Apparently free speech doesnt cover right to criticism, I guess I didn't read the Constitution right I also never hear people saying that Antifa deserved getting their faces smashed in by skinheads because they showed up to counterprotest a NatSoc rally and started shit. They don't respect our rights and beliefs, just another reason not to respect theirs"

"The 10% ""statistic"" is a lie made up by Alfred Kinsey. Thew actual percentage is far lower. It depends on the country. I am sure in many liberal nations it may even be as high as 5% but in decent socially-conservative nations it is bellow 1%. Some people are naturally homosexuals but for the most part it is a learn't behavior. Many people are even naturally psychopaths. I have noticed a link between serial killers, homosexuality and sexual degeneracy in general. I am sure a large segment of the population depending on the nation has experimented, this is how sick the modern world is. I had a female friend who experimented a fair amount though she is mostly heterosexual. I stopped being her friend. Real shame, an attractive pleasant tall woman of Aryan decent. Many men in jail experiment with buggery. This is not only because there are no women in jail but criminals are more degenerate then decent law abiding folk. I would disagree. Metapedia has its flaws is a site that is more honest then wikipedia. I would say most information on wikipedia can be trusted but anyone can edit it and it is full of communist/liberal propaganda. Stalinists and oldschool patriotic communists dislike homosexuals. When a state becomes communist it always adopts Nationalism and social-conservatism. That wikipedia on ""communism and homosexuality""even acknoledges modern communism and homosexuality are linked: ""Most communists, especially in recent times, have argued that Gay liberation is a key issue according to Marxism"". Homosexuality and other degenerate behavior such as radical feminism are linked with communism and has been since the time of Magnus Hirschfeld if not before. I am aware of Rohm, apart from that 1 flaw he was a great man. Rohm was a leftist National Socialist and I would even call him a sexual Bolshevist(minus the communism). He was a homosexual nepotist who promoted his butt buddies to high positions. Every movement has its degenerates and corrupt individuals in all movements but it is mostly communist and communist influenced movements that pander to homosexuality a great deal. Identity politics work, that is why people use them. Homosexuals have their own form of psudonationalism, thats why they have ""gay pride"". The new left support nationalism or psudonationalism unless it is the nationalism of a group that ""oppresses"" eg whites and men. This man is an interesting characher. There are a few decent homosexuals just as their are decent pychopaths. Homosexuality is very unmanly IMO. I value manliness more so then womanhood. I prefer how women look but as an elitist genrally I would rather befriend men. In many ways they are superior to men(eg lower sex drive, less criminal ect) but women are more liberal and egalitarian. There are degenerates or people with degenerate characheristics in every movement. Rohm, Otto Rahn and Yukio Mishima both had 1 great flaw. Mussolini was a womaniser but that is not that degenerate, quite a miunor flaw. Hitler was almost entirely asexual, 1 of the many reasons I view him as almost a perfect human being."
"Hail to you and thanks for acceptance, I m the administrator of the algerian radical nationalist network: El Afkar El Wataniya (Nationalist Ideas) and a member of the NPAC (National Patriotic Algerian Comitee). El Afkar el Wataniya is the meeting place of all the Algerian nationalists understand modern issues of globalism threat, immigration and miscegenation. My personal political and philosophical influences are quite numerous: Evola, Robert Dun, Rene Guenon, Tomislav Sunnic, Laurent Ozon, Gabriele Adinolfi, Ren√© Binet, GA Amaudruz,William Pierce, Miguel Serrano- Corneliu Codreanu, etc ... And I registered on this forum to follow interesting discussions, because as many of you here, I think the fascists/nationalists and racialist movements must unite and face all globalists threats as the Jewish mafia, the Islamist threat, mass immigration, cultural marxism and all the plagues of the modern world. Regards,"
"Ran out of thanks to give. Glad to hear you're keeping up the fight. My friend's in San cristobal, very agrarian manner of life up there, many of them nostalgic for Jiminez and his authoritarian style with an emphasis on anti-communism. Literally the only praise Chavez gets from fascists in Vz is his ""anti-Semitism"" which was pretty moderate and a typical case of Jews blowing things out of proportion."
"It's average I guess. A tad too pseudointellectual. It's got that ""powerpoint"" look to it, especially the business card. The eagle with the swastika replaced with some other shit is such an old overused trope. Not to mention it screams I'm afraid of using the swastika. You'd be best either using something more striking and recognizable (such as said swastika) or coming up with something more original and more specifically related to canadian nationalists. Didn't you reference NA as inspiration? You should actually take more inspiration from them, they put out this handy little booklet on the use of effective propaganda. Are you going to be spamming more of these threads about your group? Because I'll make you a dedicated playpen if so."
Did things a little backwards and joined the ranks of Atomwaffen Division before Ironmarch so now I'm here. Former teenage anarchist turned alt-right nerd until reading Siege and realizing the ideological blackhole I'd gotten myself into. Look forward to chatting it up with some of you in the future. Cheers.
An American NBU? No thanks. Let me know when an American NA is hopping about
"Oh God. NBU is so shit-tier. On the bright side, you're on the best site on the internet for fascism. Do what the other guys before me recommended and join NA."
"Hail brethren, I hope you are well. How soon do many forget Christ's hand in the Fascist movement, this thread is dedicated to reminding them. But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint. - Isaiah 40:31 Amen. We must remember and honor the Vatican's support for Hitler's reforms: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichskonkordat http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/pius.html http://www.chick.com/reading/books/153/153_03.asp Let us pray for and honor the brave men of the Iron Guard: CHRISTUS IST DER √úBERMENSCH! Every true fascist should be a Christian because Christ is victorious. A fascist is someone who values truth and righteousness; they have no place on the losing team: But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. - 1 Cor 15:57 We must remember that everything that is not of Christ shall be destroyed: And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. - Matthew 3:10 A fascist is someone who cannot tolerate evil, one who is consumed by an unquenchable fury: Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? - Psalm 139:21 A fascist is armed and prepared to do battle with those who oppose him: 10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. 11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. 13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. - Ephesians 6:10-13 A fascist is not swayed by the petty mewlings of the wicked: How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts. - Jude 1:18 A fascist values strength and reason. He gladly accepts all challengers: For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. - 2 Timothy 1:7 This thread is dedicated to the Christian Fascists who gave their lives for their Nation and their God. Let us honor their memory by exchanging stories and our thoughts about Christianity's relationship to Fascism."
"There were plenty of mistakes that he made but he ranks along the greatest Germans and statesmen. As I've said before, a final battle between Russia and Germany was inevitable, there was no way around it either from a geopolitical or racial-spiritual perspective. From the positive end, he mobilized, organized and inspired the German people as a great orator and propagandist, he set a great religious imperial goal for Germany, great ideals of augmentation in race through purity and eugenics. He truly reconciled the interests of corporation and workers and rebuilt Germany. At the same time, I am not a fan of any bureaucratic state. Under Hitler Germany developed a largely conformist culture; the bookburnings and what went with them, could not be substituted by Nazi literature and indoctrination. No matter how many times you wave your hands in the air at a rally, art, whatever is beautiful, is created by free thinkers and visionaries. You cannot reconcile that with a police state at home, and the few true Nazi artists were not enough in the slightest to produce anything like that. Similarly there was no need to behave quite so brutally in war, or in the removal of the Jews. Of course, these are moral questions and completely irrelevant as long as the goal is met, but these sorts of mistakes made the Nazis unsavoury in the eyes of many, which had a political effect, and these were basically things for which there was no need. I am not a fan of Hitler's inconsistency on religion. Neither am I on class and socialism, but at least he got the right people working for him in these fields. My last piece of criticism would be the betrayal at Kristallnacht, which Hitler could've done much to prevent. It was necessary of course to liquidate the widespread power of the SA, and establish a political soldier class much loyal to Hitler and the Nazi elites, but far too many good thinkers were taken out in this affair than necessary."
"Its simply a metapolitical movement that applies neofascism in all kind of social spheres of culture, community, school and sports. They own shops, associations, pubs and squads where they provide for their own people and community, they are represented within subcultures (Hooliganism, music, art) and student associations (Blocco Studentesco). Why would communists and anarchists have a monopoly on such important social issues? Fascism is a social movement for the (own) people, they simply claim back what belongs to them; the community. Some neighbourhoods are under control of Casa Pound, while others are under the control of communists. Needless to say they consider communists as opposition, Casa Pound is several times attacked by antifa. One of these incidents resulted in the arrest of Zippo on false allegations. They stand in the tradition of Italian social-fascism; ""fascists of the 3rd generation"". Most of their publications are in Italian. But their ideological program (A Nation) starts with something like these words (that pretty much sums it up); The Italian nation must return to being an organization with life and means of action for power and duration for those individuals, divided or grouped together, that compose it. It must be a moral political and economic unity again, which is fully realized in the State. The state we want is an ethical state, organic, inclusive, a spiritual guide and a reference of national community, a state that goes back to being spiritual and moral. His first task is to regain the sovereignty and autonomy that is threatened by strong powers, both private and internationalist. We want a free Italy, strong, out of protection, absolutely mistress of all his energies and striving for the future. An Italy that's national and social, according to the vision of the Risorgimento, Mazzini, Corridoniana, Futurists, D'Annunzio, Gentile, Pavoliniana and Mussolini. We consider all our enemy who put private interests before the common good, each individualistic and oligarchic conception of the state is our enemy. We consider anyone acting in the interests of the nation and the Italian people, who cares about its fate, beauty, social dignity as a friend. For its history and its destiny, Italy must return to and act as an avant-garde in a sovereign, united, independent, Europe."
"The problem of WN goes a bit further than simply the difficulty of removing feminism altogether from it. The other problem is the lack of clear firm stances on miscegenation &amp; homosexuality. This I think is really dragging things down to as you say the prevalence of autistism (though it serves a purpose to aggravate the establishment and undermine liberals &amp; their narratives on social media - 4th gen memetic warfare). The other problem is the lack of a manifesto and a guide for debate to help coalesce the best elements &amp; strategies of WN together. Its essentially franchise nationalism ATM which although much more resistant to the systems attempts to sabotage it, it runs the risk of being extremely undisciplined, various factions/sides degrading into degeneracy and one ruining the reputation of the other etc. This is however in the age of the internet a necessary structure to use but it just needs to become more real-world to have impact and give opportunity to put belief into action, which will not only to serve to make it masculine tradition but it will separate the gold from the chaff so that superior individuals can serve as role models &amp; who will make the movement more clear as a result. Thus I definitely agree that the world-view and practical elements are very flawed at the moment. I feel the Alt-right in some ways has more potential to grow in traditional ways then even Fascism has due to a mass cultural shift. For instance in the creation of masculine sub-culture elements like Gym culture (strongman physique) for StrongLifts, Fight Clubs or Bare-knuckle boxing and reviving Dueling (holmgang). Which is European in origin and compatible with the spirit of Aryans - more extreme then even many of things proposed on IM. This would provide that ability for the WN to put some of its proposed principles of strength, courage, focus, self-sacrifice and honor into practice as it manifests into physical movements. The reason why its possible is because of the coalescing of oldschool WN characteristics that still understands traditionalism (e.g the 10 eternal truths) with the Mano-sphere under the Alt-right. World-view and practicality respectively converging into something better than it was individually. The natural step after that is futurism."
"This shit is awesome, the most inspirational activism Ive ever seen. This paints our enemies into a corner should they choose to address the video because they have to literally side with the pedos, or imply that NA are somehow worse. Plus it begs the question that why can NA find these people when the police cant? Stuff like this is NA taking the first steps at delegitimizing the state and acting as a parallel institution to protect children that the state is willing to sacrifice for the sake of the narrative."
"THESE ARE NOT NEW STRATEGIES! IF YOU HAD READ THESE MATERIALS AS YOU CLAIM YOU DID YOU'D SEE THEY WERE TRIED AND FAILED 50 YEARS AGO! You know who were the closest to victory? People like Hitler and Rockwell. Fuck off. Yes I do, because I am sick and tired of clone#4352 saying the exact same BULLSHIT that has been disproven exactly as many times, for the purposes of which we released comprehensive materials answering these claims, and yet morons like you insist on NOT READING THEM and being facetious about everything and coming up with retarded strawmen! You are a prime example of why ""debating"" and ""converting"" is bullshit and make the perfect case for why its more efficient to just put a bullet in certain people's heads, because otherwise they will keep wasting everyone's time and energy, much like how the altright deserves a proverbial bullet to kill it off, for the exact same reasons. People like you are the prime reason for failure, because you all insist on trying the same lameass trick that failed repeatedly in the past so hard that those who tried it fall into obscurity so each new ignorant successor thinks he invented the fucking wheel! AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO TO BREAK THAT CYCLE IS READ SOME MATERIALS! Exhibit 6,000,000 why you are a liar who never read jack shit and doesn't understand the nature of this struggle. Last time: are you going to try and learn or insist on being a pretentious, facetious liar?"
"I think Front National is a pretty cool guy, eh kills arabs and doesn't afraid of anything. While the Front National is ardently republican and a proponent of laicite, those are the two things that bother me the most about them (that and their undetermined stance on abortion and the like). Otherwise, they're pretty Bonapartist in idea - populist, referendum-loving, anti-EU and so on. Marine Le Pen is definitely not her father, and there are issues with the manner she runs the party that many people find objectionable - a possible name change, a ""softening"" of positions. There's still a long way to go before they win any major election victories, so really one should reserve judgment and see if the strategy will pay off."

"Local media are at it again, but this time with a different angle http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/sinister-dangerous-trio-quit-new-5096951 The thing about the NBU is it geared specifically to garner publicity - even in an instance like this, where it is clear that the organisation is a paper tiger - as this article state people are appointed officers who consent to appointment through a private message without any loyalty or committment to the organisation - but nobody is seizing on this fact. A party that to my knowlege has had no meetings and is all internet actually got on the sun - which is unbelievable. What I don't understand is what is the point of media attention? - what will it do for the organisation. NBU is despite what it thinks, not a public party - ordinary members of the public don't just go joining the NBU - its base is in existing nationalists only. all that has transpired is the organisation is being exposed as 'racist' and 'anti-semitic' as if to directly prove how the jewish 'appeasement' strategy utterly fails. take what you will from that - I don't think this is being played on more that one level but this is good to note for future reference. How about we set up phoney patriotard fascist movements and recruit autists only to sink the project in a similar way - so people can draw the proper inferences? I am actually willing to admit that I have come into contact with a potential class A and there are some good people who are associated with that organisation - though the nature of that association is casual and most have private misgivings. If you mean infiltrating that - then it is a walk in the park because these people are not incorporated. As for the real NBU, it is a central clique that cannot be persuaded or penetrated, it cannot be reasoned with. As I have already discussed the likelyhood of a split/coup due to these issues is likely."
"I will start off with a stark introduction of myself and later explain some my ideologies and plans. I think some of you might be keen on what I have to say, so read closely. I searched this forum and it seems there is not a lot of talk about farming and Permaculture. Anybody with common sense knows that agriculture lays out the foundation to any society or civilization. This is essentially what moved humans out of hunter-gatherer societies into domesticated environments, allowing us to advance. We all take it for granted everyday; our food source, and our farmers. Permaculture is the process of creating a self-sustainable ecosystem. Any political ideology can technically be used with it, as every type of society needs a source of food. I will explain more about Permaculture and farming later in this post. A brief explanation/history is linked below: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture I consider myself as a firm believer of Neo-Fascism and Traditionalism. Some influences of mine include Dmowski, Evola, Mussolini, and Codreanu. I am currently 18 years old and reside in the United States. I was born in Sweden to an American Father of Celtic heritage, and a Polish mother. I grew up living in Poland, Sweden, and the US (where I've spent most of my life) and speak decent Polish. Ever since I was a child, I have had a great value for European tradition, language, and history. These were things I was brought up with around my family. Like most of you on here, I am infuriated by the downfall and complete mockery of our homeland. It has been smeared by Leftist politics, multiculturalism, and Zionism. Europeans are angry and confused at this rapid change, and many people are trying to find a solution. However, let me tell you that waiting on a race war or some kind of cataclysmic event is useless, because it probably won't happen. You will be suppressed by the government and its police force. Shooting sprees and violence are also quiet obsolete, just look at people like Dylann Roof or Anders Breivik; they made absolutely no change by committing acts of violence, and now sit in prison cells for the rest of their lives. It happens so frequently now and as an individual, it is unlikely that you will implement a huge change by doing this. So what is the solution to all of this? There is none. No political solution is currently present. The odds are stacked against us, and the people with money and power glare down from their high chairs. Now I'm sure you've heard the saying, ""If you can't beat em', join em'!"". This is correct - to an extent. Try to utilize experience to help your own cause. Let me give you an example of my own life choice: I am about enlist in the United States Marine Corps. I am not doing this to fight for the interest of Israel or rich people, I am doing this for me. The military gives you skills that you will not learn anywhere else in the world. You learn self-defense, survival skills, fitness, obedience, weapons training, and achievement. As a Fascist, I believe every young man should serve in the military - it creates men. Also, if anyone here is considering joining, remember to shut the fuck up and leave your opinions at the door. The last thing you want is your nigger DI overhearing your racist bullshit when you snicker behind his back - you WILL be kicked out for racism. Tattoos are another thing. If you enter with some kind of totenkopf or pagan tattoo, they will classify you as a gang member. Neo-Nazis in Iraq and Afghanistan would go on civilian shooting sprees and the military eventually caught on to this. They will identify you with any type of symbolism you put out. Don't blow it, just put in your 4 years and get it over with. Even if you are not joining the military, work on yourself. Practice what you preach. Fascism and National Socialism are aimed at creating positive and strong men and women. If you claim these ideologies, then act like it. Wear presentable clothing, get a nice haircut, and stop fucking wasting all your time on the internet. Go out on jogs and hikes. Go to the gym. Go enjoy nature, and learn new skills. Cut all the degeneracy from your life. Stop watching pornography, stop smoking and drinking so frequently, and stay away from drugs and degenerate people. Also remember, National Socialism and Fascism are not about hate - it is about strength, confidence and superiority. Hate consumes all your energy and drags you into a pit of nihilism and depression. I've been there. We all don't like niggers and minorities, but they aren't leaving anytime soon. Stop focusing on them and focus on yourself. Separate yourself from the noise. Like I said before, hurting/killing them will not do anything. Back to the topic of Goals/Agriculture, after my service I plan to move to Poland. I will probably do a few years of university there. I have plans with a few friends to build a homestead and to start Permaculture on the property. Permaculture at first starts off small. You can start to grow basic fruits and vegetables like berries, potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and cucumbers. If you have success with this, then add to the picture. Grow bigger plants, and get livestock like chickens, pigs, and cows. Start to raise your own ecosystem and become self-sustainable. Also, and I cant stress this enough, put everything to use. Don't waste things. In the video below, Varg Vikernes gives some examples: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZY5yR6NZ8A Varg might be crazy, but he's not stupid. He actually practices Permaculture himself with his family. Some of his videos give tips on living an Off-The-Grid lifestyle. There is always much to learn about agriculture. Go to farms and ask questions, search the web, always strive to learn something new. The internet always has good sources. This link provides the ""12 Principles of Permaculture"". It shows the original design principles of Permaculture. These methods should be applied when developing your ecosystem - it will help you become more self reliant. https://justlists.wordpress.com/2010/01/14/principles-of-permaculture/ When it came to agriculture and supplies, our ancestors always worked hard and prepared for the future, and so should you. Always be ready for any outcome. You never know when something could go wrong, so plan in advance and store things that could come in use. Storing items very important, as it can serve you in a time of need. Store things like: Water, Foods that don't expire, Toilet paper, Ammo and Weapons, Wood, Gas, Matches/Lighters, Blankets, Warm Clothes, Tools for grooming, and First-Aid. These are necessities that we take for granted everyday. Always have an abundant supply of them. Believe it or not, but ""Survivalism"" and ""Prepping"" are becoming popular. Due to all the global stress lately, people want to prepare for the worst. With all the tensions in Poland with the EU, Ukraine, and Russia, many people have started to engage in these lifestyles. Paramilitary and Militia groups have also been growing: http://www.dw.com/en/paramilitary-groups-ready-to-defend-poland/a-19325101 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob4eh7d_Kys http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-poland-militias-idUSKBN0MG24I20150320 These actions have been recently supported in Poland, and while there are strict gun regulations, people who can prove responsibility can obtain them. I actually know quiet a bit of Poles who own firearms. I have a few friends who are in Stra≈º Graniczna (Border Guards), and we plan to start training together, and to start training others as well. I know a few people in the US Military who plan to also train people in Europe after their service. As Europeans, we must retake our homeland, not with the offensive, but with the defensive. Forming a Paramilitary is a great idea, and can be synonymous with living with an OTG lifestyle. This is why Military experience can be so useful. All these things can contribute to a self-sustainable lifestyle, and it can all be done legally. Its a Europeans duty to protect his people and culture. One day, its possible that an opportunity could appear for us to put this into practice. Lets use our time wisely to work on ourselves, and to help our fellow Europeans. Thank you for reading. I hope to meet new people on here with similar views."
"Kek are you guys serious with this nonsense? Worshiping Hitler as some type of god? I admire Mussolini but I don't think of him as a literal god type being, this is taking the persoanltiy cult around Hitler to a ridiculous extreme. A lot of this stuff is excellent for memes and trolling, but to seriously put stock into any of Devi's autistic shit is hilarious, considering that she herself had relations with a non white Hindu."
&gt;what have you got to offer NA? 'I can stand and hold a flag' lol
We in AWD for new recruits we have satanic meth fueled orgies as we stomp the American flag and curse out Drumpf.
"Hey so I've talked to the owner of the AWD account on twitter off and on for a few months since either late 2016 or early 2017 (I forget and the original account got shoah'd) and they interviewed and everything, but then it just stopped. I talked to Patmos about it and he said he'd talk to the boss about it and he reported back that you all weren't recruiting at this time. That was like a month (maybe slightly less) ago. I'd really like to join though so I figured I'd check around this board for a start."
"This isn't the final straw, but a lightning rod event that will only intensify and escalate already present trends. The migrant crisis has has fueled a growing climate of dissent and panic among ever larger sections of the population (the arsons and protests in Germany, Golden Dawn in Greece, the the gun-buying panic in Austria, the 180 degree shift on border policy the Slav governments are making), and Paris only adds a heavy burst of gasoline to the fire. As for the media trying to present things as 'the new normal', this is just panicked damage control as they can see a significant backlash already forming in the wake of this attack and are no longer confident in their abilities to keep control of things. But they are partially right, in that Islamist terrorist attacks inside our borders from refugees and immigrants are only going to become more frequent. However, in contrast to the terrorist attacks of the 2000s (9/11, London, Madrid etc), this wave of ISIS-inspired attacks are going to give the impression of a war inside the borders of western nations and on the streets of their cities, rather than a few Al-Qaeda radicals from overseas squeezing through the net and managing to land a blow. Paris shows that the system is woefully incompetent when it comes to preventing attacks, who could have imagined a 130-person massacre in it's capital a mere 10 months after the Charlie Hebdo killings? They will be as equally useless when it comes to preventing reprisal actions by white Europeans who feel that the government isn't capable of protecting them and take matters into their own hands. I can almost guarantee we have a French Breivik in the making after this event."
"Last may we had our annual gathering in bloomington, Illinois, with about 40 people where we discussed the restoration of our religious organization beyond the point which our former leader matt hale had it. To begin this process we printed a 100 copies of natures eternal religion and the white mans bible. We also formed a council of our most active and senior members who will help push our movement forward. This year we have reprinted half of Ben klassen's books and have printed nearly 500 copies of nature's eternal religion and the white mans bible. I personally advocate distributing at least one copy of nature eternal religion to friend, coworker, or even members of other pro white organizations. June 6th we are meeting again in Illinois for any who wish to come contact reverend James Logsdon on the contact page of our main website www.creativitymovement.net"
"We all know who Osama Bin Laden is, so I won't post the usual Wikipedia bio. Obviously we Americans grew up being taught that he was the Arabic Hitler, but recently I have grown interested in him. He was a radical, lover of his people, popular with the poor, and waged war on their enemies. I dislike Muslims immensely, and they have been our enemies for thousands of years, but you gotta give Osama his props, he was not willing to bow down to the American-Israeli aggression."
I'm interested in the AW.
It doesn't say anything about Georgia I live in the smallest town of redneckville you can imagine not exactly a place atomwaffen would be. Im not susceptible its more so an annoyance ya know? Like I'm not going to be brainwashed because two faggots are kissing. It's more so things like the show Gotham it was really good imo up until they started forcing in that lesbian relationship.

"You could message them on their site. (http://www.natalt.org/) If they aren't active there, then you can contact Misanthropic Division, I know they have a chapter in Australia.

"Dmowski was pretty anti-German because of the partitions. I think I read once that he had sympathies to Hitler though. Wouldn't really surprise me if he did. Many politicians were being influenced by Hitler, Franco, and Mussolini at the time (There was a Pro-Hitler politician and publicist who tried during the war to integrate the Polish Army into the Wehrmacht but the NSDAP refused - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_Studnicki). In the interwar period, Anti-Semitism was rampant in Poland. Jews were actually legally segregated at Universities in ghetto benches. I know what picture you're talking about btw, the infograph with ""Hitler and Pi√Ö‚Äösudski"". It used this picture in it: Also, another pre-war photo with Goebbels and Pi√Ö‚Äösudski: I'm glad you're a Condreanu fan because I am too. I think Iron Guard is a legendary movement. Unfortunately Soviet kikes stole our border with Romania so Poland was never able to really interact or build a strong relationship. I consider myself to be a Clerical Fascist and I am impressed on how he made his movement devoutly Orthodox. Faith in god is great. Real men need God. And to clarify what I said with ""uninterested and unimpressed"", I was not referring to Jobbik, but ONR. I support Jobbik immensely. As far as I know, the reason Falanga was created because a member named Bartosz Bekier was kicked out or something for being ""too radical"", so he just made his own group. There are actual Falanga members on IM so you could ask them the specifics. My group is very private so I'll be willing to address it if you private message me. As for off-Topic Polish history, we can still use this thread, since heroes are synonymous to history. Ask away Magyar!"
"Sort of interesting, though some of the Glenn Beck 'links' don't entirely stick with me - an insight none the less. Nick sounds like he is hitting out at his own party more than the EDL, it should not escape anyone that there is a little bit of mental dissonance. Nick acts like the BNP and EDL are a race apart, in some respects they are; unlike the BNP, a majority of EDL members I am certain do not actually take the party line, though they may accept some of the principles and talking points they seem like mostly good people. Unless you actually get a set up to fail Geert Wilders Daily Mail party succeed, the result of an organisation like the EDL will just snowball into national socialism the way breivik did."
"What is this pure unadulterated autism? To my knowledge youre aren't even part of Atomwaffen division so why the hell are you trying to profit off their work? We dont care about fashy shirts here, we dont care about the free market, and we sure as hell dont want an outsider with 9 post selling shirts for us."
"Overtime I began to become more and more disenchanted with modern society. Ever sense I was young I always yearned for purity, a purity which, as I observed would never come from modernity. I began to feel a bit displaced in my need for purity and a clean society, I also began to read on people who had ideas on society. When I was young about 14 or so I just spent most of my time reading mostly Marx, Mussolini, Hitler, etc. I when read Mein Kampf I was stunned and mesmerized, all my life in school I was told that this was an evil man, but after my research I discovered the contrary. I was also inspired my Julius Evola, Corneliu Zelea, Codreanu, and Francisco Franco whom all are icons of success and strength. I just kept up my research and It lead me to here, after all these years I have found a system that works and thankfully like minded people as well."
"Hello, fellow Fascists! My name is Jason Augustus, I am the head of propaganda for the Traditionalist Worker Party and owner of Upsilon Creations. I have been involved in Nationalism for about sixteen years, although my activism hit a speed bump for about four years for various reasons; mostly involving the stagnation within the cause at the time. In recent years I've been rejuvenated and energized like never before. The past few years have been very interesting and provided me a much needed kick to get back involved. Aside from my media work with TradWorker, designing leaflets, stickers, videos, etc, I enjoy writing and recording music. My current project is a full-length album in the Metalcore genre called, ""14 Sacred Words."" I play various genres of music, and in the near future I plan to release more. The Nationalist music scene in the US has been through a bit of a dry spell since the late 90's, and one of my goals is to change that, not only with my own projects, but I also offer to record and mix Nationalist bands and musicians in the US free of charge. When I'm not creating multimedia, I'm out on the road with TradWorker participating in various forms of activism, whether it be door-knocking and speaking to people in local communities about the issues facing our people, or going out to rallies and conferences to network with other Nationalists. I would craft a list of hobbies like video games, beer pong, or knitting or something, but the entirety of my life is fully dedicated to the advancement of our cause using all means at my disposal. I would be dishonest, however, if I did not admit I have a lot of fun doing so. My reason for joining the Iron March community is to connect with others walking this path. To contribute my knowledge of the various fields in which I've become proficient, and hopefully to learn from others who are proficient in fields I'm not familiar with. Through my lurking I've already come across threads that I feel my contribution might be valued and critiqued by intelligent people. I believe this forum will provide honest criticism of my works and strategies, rather than the saturated fields of social media where criticism is generally limited to praise from yes-men and hate from Jewish minions. (Not implying all fans of my work are yes-men) To quote Fascist Lemming, It's an honor and a White privilege to be here. Hail Victory!"
"Dox never, Atomwaffen forever"
"He was a great man, I felt that way before my conversion to the Orthodoxy. One thing that kills me -I'll admit he is one of my heroes- but there isn't much of his particular ideology that we can apply in the US. My writings were a bit influenced by him, and his revolutionary tactics can be applied like building a better nation starting NOW with community service, but he was naturally and rightly so saturated with Orthodox theology that we have to be careful on how we approach him in a non-Orthodox nation. Yes, I use the swastika and stuff which technically is foreign but think of it like this. Murrika' founded by Germanic People, According to US consensus it is the largest white Ethnicity in the nation, we've had some success with swastika movements (ok, that was an overstatement but the ANP, NA, W.A.R. NSLF under Tommasi had achieved some things in their own right) the swastika kind of became our defacto aesthetic and idea. Iron Guard-Orthodox, Greco-Latin, 'nuff said. I do have an IG flag on my wall. I'm a fan. But also a realist."

"NS is not another term for fascism, fascism is fascism, NS is only a form of fascism but not everything fascist is necessarily related to NS, which was simply inspired by Italian fascism to certain extent. Americans preaching Europeans about fascism, give me a break please Besides, German NS don't call themselves ""fascists"" and don't use these two terms interchangeably, they're just called this way by leftists. You're basically using leftist terminology."

"An American Revolutionary Hero To the media and the masses he is known as Joseph Franklin but he was known to me as James Vaughn. He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison in Utah for the killing of two Negroes and two White race traitors. There can be hardly any question he was responsible for more than just those but this was all that the terrified and outraged System could hang on him. His story as it was made public ran for just about one year exactly, from the time of his arrest to the time of his sentencing. He made it known that he was one of us, he never buckled, he told 'em what they were in open court, and he damned-near escaped at the end. What a man! Pray we can each measure up to him one day. But as I knew Vaughn in 1969 at what was Party Headquarters at that time, there is no question he would have been voted ""least likely to succeed as a Right Winger"". Perhaps that was a fair assumption because a hard-core Right Winger would never have resorted to anything as unsophisticated and crude as direct action against the Enemy. I recall the night one of the most important missions of the year was in jeopardy because some of the men chosen to go out on it were refusing to be accompanied by Vaughn as part of the team that was to attack the ""New Mobe"" headquarters in Washington, D.C. I was forced to call each one up individually and beg and plead, shame and cajole until I could get them to come to their senses and perform their duty. More than once I was hung up on and had to dial them right back up. In the end, while the rest of us provided escort and the back-up, it was Vaughn who caused the place to be evacuated and closed. Why? Because he was the only one among us who didn't LOOK like a ""Fascist"" and who could move easily about, in and amongst the numbers of the Enemy, and get the necessary work done undetected. And why was it that the rest, at first, refused to be in the same vehicle with Vaughn as part of the same mission? For the identical same reason: he didn't ""fit in"" as a member of the cult. For the same reasons he could never have been accepted as a Party Member by those rules in those days. And they wonder why the Right Wing is impotent?! There was a hell of a lesson in what took place that night and even I didn't fully catch its meaning. I congratulate myself that I did successfully place the performance of duty over personal preference. But I too would have been one of those who'd agreed in 1969 that it would be ""nice"" were Vaughn to have a regulation haircut and a squared-away uniform. But, given the ""real"" circumstances of the moment and the mission at hand to be undertaken, those two things would have spelled flat failure. I have since learned that it is NOT how you play the game that counts, it is WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE! The Party scored a big victory that night over huge odds and could have gone on and on smashing the Enemy and rolling up fighting recruits had not ""rules and regulations"" won out. Vaughn and dozens of others like him became quickly alienated by all that garbage and they departed. However, he went on to make a bigger splash and account for more solid results than ANY of the others present at that time. He was caught. Does that make him a failure? Was it worth it to him and to us? Some have called it the ""threshold of anger"", others call it the ""breaking point"". We have seen it happen in the cases of a dozen comrades in the past decade in the U.S. The moment when one can no longer stand idly by in the face of countless, incessant outrages and when one decides that personal safety and comfort no longer have any real meaning. At that moment, he becomes a revolutionary. He goes on the attack. He becomes a part of the first wave, which must exist if there is to be a second or third or fourth, regardless of cost. Vaughn didn't go the farthest but he did go farther than the average. It's notoriously easy to kill indiscriminately in the big city. It's less easy√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú a LOT less easy√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú to kill politically and racially anywhere in this sick land and keep going for very long. The heat was ON once Vernon Jordan was shot. Life on the run can be desperate and Vaughn was reduced to selling blood for cash to survive. That's when he made his mistake and was recognized by the ""Grim Reaper"" tattoo on his forearm by a nurse who promptly dime-dropped on him, betraying him to Big Brother. From that point and for the next twelve months Vaughn was intermittently covered by the media and always it was brought up that he had killed two mixed couples that had been jogging down the highway. His trial being held in Salt Lake City, Utah, one would expect his jury to have been practically all White. Yet they convicted him of murder knowing that he could draw the death sentence. How many ""White"" juries have I seen thus convict? It has been said that a people deserves whatever it permits. Only a sick people would permit what prevails today. Vaughn would have done better by himself had he chosen to rob banks for money rather than sell his blood. (For, after all, when you are already wanted for two murders, what the hell?) It is debatable whether he did the right thing in allowing himself to be captured for he could have been sentenced to ""death by injection"", a truly fiendish, characteristically Big Brother means of disposing of trouble-makers. As it is, he waits for us. Do we let him down? Precisely which wave will free him from Big Brother's prison? I have not read a single word in any Right Wing publication√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú Nazi or Klan regarding James Vaughn/Joseph Franklin, either for or against. It is as though he has become a non-person. One could then safely assume the so-called ""Movement"" has disowned him or wants no part of him. But by ""playing it safe"" they do not ""disown"" Vaughn, they in effect RULE THEMSELVES OUT as being worthy of anything except total oblivion. And this insanity and this crime they've committed for the umpteenth time in recent years. They refuse to learn. The real meaning of Commander Rockwell's favorite excerpt from Mein Kampf comes to mind at this time: ""When human hearts break and human souls despair, the great vanquishers of distress and care, of shame and misery, of spiritual slavery and physical duress look down upon them from the twilight of the past and hold out their eternal hands to fainthearted mortals. WOE TO THE PEOPLE THAT IS ASHAMED TO GRASP THEM!"" [Vol. X, # 11 √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú Nov., 1981]"
"My post was a response to Banana's attack on National Syndicalism for what essentially amounted to ""not being Nazi enough,"" not on what you or Jake said. And as I've said before, I respect Hitler's methods, but both you and I know Hitler represents much more than methods. He represents ideas, he represents his regime, and he represents the 1930's German spirit. I don't feel a need to plaster Hitler or his party's symbols all over supposedly American ideals. Not only are they foreign symbols, but I find the co-opting of the NSDAP's symbolism and rhetoric by parties or movements in non-German nations (ie; USA, Russia, etc.) as intellectually weak and as political plagiarism bordering on fetishism. in b4 ""if u dont use swastika u a coward"""
"A nigger church is not a fucking 'holy place', I don't see why we should give a shit about that. The church he shot up was a place visited by MLK and some of Obama's personal friends. Dylann attacked an unholy temple of the Judeo-Christian slave religion, a sanctuary for beasts and race traitors. God is on the side of truth, and the ultimate truth is racism. If you aren't going to do anything for your race then you have NO excuse to complain about Aryan warriors of Dylann's caliber. About him killing 'random blacks', he killed a fucking State Senator, that's what I call striking at the heart of the enemy."
"Dylann is a hero, he did what he thought was right to continue acclerationism and to kill a bunch of BLM fuckers and Jews. People whining about morality here about nigger babies and elderly is laughable, only defeat is immoral, Zero Tolerance."
