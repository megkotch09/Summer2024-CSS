"applying 21st century standards to a 7th century dune coon is pretty retarded but even 2 seconds of research will show you that child marriages are common even in Europe historically, you can come up with better reasons why islam is shit"
"Ok, this was a marxist-maoist terrorist group. What got me amused is the fact that they were, not anti-zionist, but anti-semitic, with directly anti-jewish propaganda and with openly denunciations of zionist-american plot on Banks against the american people, and zionist involvement in American Imperialism around the globe. Also they labeled homosexuality as reactionary, they were hierarchical and militarists, denouncing democracy and other shits. They also submited the shitheading of femenism as subordinated to class concerns. It is logical, that their marxist aproach to reality was a Lie, but they are not different in that sense to some other religious fanatics in practice i need to recognize that this group is more Rightwing and conservative than any other shits back there in United States: when a libertarian talk about how from conservative and traditional right they are, you just show them this. I only can said that is shame to you gringos, that a marxist-maoíst have most fascists behavior and also got the balls to do some god and ol' terrorism and at the same time, the rightwing in your country cannot deploy those good aspects propertly. Thats sad. I think this could serve as reference to a Futurist revolution, the hierarchical and causi-military organization could be borrowed, I think Tommasi thinked like that when he chose the name of NSFL. http://radicalarchives.org/2010/02/06/nwlf-1977/"
"After my visit to Auschwitz I was deeply emotionally changed in regards to this. I saw the horrible crimes of the evil nazis, and how we all should remember this terrible event. Now that mossad regards me as a good goy... GAS THE KIKES!"

But he is kike so that reminds me the marxist-judeo conspiracy against ChristianS Nation (like my Venezuela linda) and all that stuff."
"The worst thing about that is that they could him for selling counterfeit clothing, for fuck's sake!

"i called you edgy cause youre talking about a war between christians and pagans before we've even started really organizing for the true war. even if its bound to happen, to speak of it now does nothing but promote factionalism. retake europe from muzzies first before we even start to consider retaking it from christ. and i was making an allegory but perhaps it was too vague, the early anglo saxon christians were not as christian as the churches would have liked them to have been, and oftentimes when a tribe was converted they simply put a jesus idol inside the pagan temple that already existed. this was partly because the church was too far away to really have influence yet, and the mostly illiterate pagans often misunderstood the missionaries readings of scripture. their true conversion was a gradual process over about a century and at the end of that Christ was the only idol in the temple, and eventually they destroyed all the old temples and replaced them with churches (its also interesting to note they destroyed the temples by tying chains around it, throwing a spear into its doors and burning it, almost as if a final offering to woden)"
"So what? The definition of communism is [insert dictionary definition of communism] but that does not change the staggering elephant-in-the-room corelation why a massive amount of degenerates, traitors and fags are communists (and coincidentally anti-religion) Same with atheism/secularism (which seems to be completely faggot saturated, even the so called ""religious"" faggots who treat their religion so lightly and insignificantly). Atheism/Secularism is the disease of modern urban lives that has destroyed the Hinduism's strength. It's too obvious. Sorry friend but atheism must be removed from premises and put in the bin. Don't let the secular poison touch the dying Hindu man. God is great. God hates Atheism. God hates Fags"
"Fortunately I'm not a gypsy, but I meant more as in very that I have no mudslime, nig, etc. As far as I know I am 100% white from a mix of russkie, english, scottish and a little bit of potato. In fact, my grandmother is a russian kike but the entire family doesn't do one bit of the jewish religion, I've never seen a synagogue in my life and they eat pig regularly and don't celebrate hanukkah. Edit: I don't care if I'm not 110% white, but I would rather it and also verification would be nice"
"Eastern Orthodoxy is the one true religion of God and monotheism, but I have some respect for Islam, like Zadrugar says because of its similarities to my own religion. There is no question however that they are our enemies much like the Catholics, but not to as great an extent as the Catholics. Also quite low on the list of things I am concerned about. On the topic of Orthodoxy though, I have a strong conviction that the church here in North America is losing its quality due to the number of converts. Thank God my church is Serbian---the service is in Serbian, everyone that attends is Serbian---but I am particularly concerned about the Russian one, popular amongst converts. In America, there are congrengations that are more American than Russian, eventually, the service is in English, and the priests and monks become American, English, Canadian, whatever. These people don't have an Orthodox tradition and often bring their own values with them to infest the church."
"Rene Guenon Frithjof Schuon Ananda Coomaraswamy Do you mean Perennialism? Are you talking about the Traditionalist School that holds that all religions are fundamentally based on the same metaphysical principles? If you do, and you subscribe to that world-view, then it would follow that you would embrace what very little is left of medieval Christianity, even as a staunch pagan. It would also follow that you would recognize that the revival of a half-dead religion with intact (even though fairly illegitimate) hierarchy would be preferable compared to the revival of a completely dead religion that lacks any hierarchy. Assuming you want Europe to remain Europe and not become Europistan. Something has to fill the void left by atheism, and the only serious candidates are Islam or a resurgence of traditional Christianity. Personally, I'm convinced that fate is completely impartial to this, but I am equally convinced that the European character must and should be preserved. I seriously doubt that there is any person living today that can foretell whether or not a restored Christendom will triumph over an Islamic Europe, but I am certain that a European man who loves Europe would struggle for Europe's best hope at maintaining it's character rather then being misdirected by a pseudo-traditional line of thinking."

"This is a great redpill/insight http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/threeyearold-ultraorthodox-jewish-children-told-the-nonjews-are-evil-in-worksheet-produced-by-school-10481682.html Three-year-old ultra-Orthodox Jewish children told 'the non-Jews' are 'evil' in worksheet produced by London school British three-year-olds have been told ""the non-Jews"" are “evil” in a Kindergarten worksheet handed out at ultra-Orthodox Jewish schools in north London, it can be revealed. Documents seen by The Independent show children are taught about the horrors of the Holocaust when they are still in kindergarten at the Beis Rochel boys’ school in north London. A whistle-blower, who wished to remain anonymous, has shown The Independent a worksheet given to boys aged three and four at the school. In it, children were asked to complete questions related to the holiday of 21 Kislev, observed by Satmer Jews as the day its founder and holy Rebbe, Rabbi Yoel Teitelbaum, escaped the Nazis. The document refers to Nazis only as “goyim” – a term for non-Jews some people argue is offensive. Emily Green, who used to teach at the same Beis Rochel girls’ secondary school, now chairs the Gesher EU organisation which supports ultra-Orthodox Jews who want to leave the community. ""It's not uncommon to be taught non-Jewish people are evil in ultra-Orthodox Jewish schools. It is part of the prayers, teaching, their whole ethos,” she said. Describing it as a form of “indoctrination”, Ms Green added: “Psychologically, you become so afraid of the world out there after being taught how dangerous and bad and evil non-Jews are, that it makes it harder to leave.” Independently translated from Yiddish for The Independent, the worksheet's first question reads: “What have the evil goyim (non-Jews) done with the synagogues and cheders [Jewish primary schools]?” The answer in the completed worksheet reads: “Burned them.” Another question asks: “What did the goyim want to do with all the Jews?” – to which the answer, according to the worksheet, is: “Kill them.”. “It doesn’t explicitly refer to the Holocaust,” the source said. “It’s a document that teaches very young children to be very afraid and treat non-Jews very suspiciously because of what they did to us in the past. ""It’s not a history lesson – you can’t say that. It’s a parable that is actively teaching the children extremism, hatred and a fear for the outside world.” A spokesperson for Beis Rochel said that the worksheets would be amended and apologised for any offence. However they argued the phrase “goyim” was not offensive and accusations that they were indoctrinating children were “without basis”. “The language we used was not in any way intended to cause offence, now this has been brought to our attention, we will endeavour to use more precise language in the future.”"
At least niggers are not as bad as the jews.

"So I am the dictator of the Republic of Korea, the South Korea; the one and true one... What would I do to other races/religions that are non-native South Korean? Simple: (1a) Make all people who are inter-marrying with South Koreans only be allowed visas through the same measures that normal, unmarried foreigners require. This would insure all people marrying South Koreans and residing there would be either students (who have a future) or people who have graduate degrees and useful employment. It would prevent people from marrying low quality folks just looking for a handout... And it'd also insure that the sort of scum who can only import wives from third world countries because they've generally failed at life simply do not have the opportunity to breed. They'd have kids with less opportunities and would be generally less worthwhile. (1b) People who have married in and can prove that they are of use to the society by holding down steady employment and speaking the language well and having no criminal history can be granted full citizenship, etc. (2) Revoke all missionary and religious visit based visas except for mainstream Buddhist &amp; Christian organizations. Nothing wacky in. (3a) Monitor fringe religious groups -- do not let them leave and embarrass the nation and have a de facto blacklist preventing them from working in the government, having security clearances and being military officers. (3b) Monitor all racial minorities. Not as individuals but as groups. See if there is any actual trend of violence or crime and if it exists expose it publicly, imprison everyone guilty and advertise to the world that no visas will be renewed for five+ years for any country that has allowed to emmigrate in any amount of what is perceived as organized crime. Find out the countries/groups that always have clean records and prioritize their visas. (4) Only allow foreign workers/students from a list of countries that is generally suitable (as seen above). Generally do not allow in anyone from non-OECD/1st world countries except through official government programs and exchanges with those countries."
"I don't believe that redpills are enough for someone. Unless they're born NS, the average redpilled man isn't going to necessarily be a good thing for a movement. They might follow orders, but their heart won't be in it and because of that, they won't be in the movement for much longer. You can call what I'm saying semantics, but I think there is a difference between being redpilled and being NS. /pol/'s a good example: They might know that Jews run everything and recognize some other redpills, but considering they house some sickening degeneracies and do jack shit to actually fight the Jews, no one in their right mind would call them NS. Proper Leadership could purge them, true. Using them is asking for absolute trouble considering they constitute 9/10 of the entire movement and with what NS entails, it is highly unlikely that they'd be good for anything you'd try and use them for. tbh, a lot of these questions don't matter. Think; if the Alt-Right actually became legit NS and started acting like such, could one really consider them to be the Alt-Right anymore or would they not be something else entirely?"
The levels of self parody the kikes will sink to just to make a few extra shekels is beyond belief.
"I believe in God, people, and nation. I believe God should come first, and that goes hand-in-hand with the spirit of the nation which is vital to the evolution to Codreanu's New Man. I believe in race wholeheartedly, I am sad to see so many people nowadays losing sight of the treasure in their blood. Obviously I hate faggotry, it is anti Christian, and a degenerative dead end. Jews I despise more than all others, see Revelation 2:9, Revelation 3:9, John 8:44, Luke 19:27, they murdered Christ, bastardize nations, and must be removed. My stance on violence may differ from some people who I have seen here, and that is I believe violence is necessary when you have a pure movement, and start becoming a popular movement, then it is necessary to kill traitors, jews, and anybody who aims to obstruct God's path. What I do not agree with are the lone wolf shooters, who make headlines and drive our brothers and sisters of European descent who have not been fully awakened yet further from our movements. We should always be looking to expand our sphere of influence, and think of the future on a large scale. The lone wolf shooters give us a bad name and drive many of our brothers and sisters away."
"Have they tried anything since 1941? Russia isn't going to try to invade a NATO-tied - as much as I don't like NATO, Russsia does recognize its authority - country. Finland is also a part of the EU, which goes without saying. Now, once the EU collapses and NATO loses power, then you guys can worry but we have at least another 15 years before that happens, so focus on the real physical enemy that is going to be pouring in from Sweden (SJW, Muslims, Africans etc). This is just my opinion."
"See, from a secular perspective I agree. I depsise Protestantism from a religious perspective though. It encourages the loss of authority and centrallization necessary forthe Christian Faith."
"Americans tend to be less serious about Islam because it is not as much of a threat here and the only people you hear going off about Muslims are Fox news Republicans and the like. I can see how it would be entirely different in Europe. It would be like if Europeans were complaining about Mexican drug cartels or something. It just isn't a problem there like Islam isn't too much of a problem here. But looking into Islamic history, you can see how much of a plague it has been everywhere it goes."

"Slavros, I've always wanted to do this to a Russian. As I pointed before, I'd like an economic piece on Corporatism. Would you be willing to do that? See Elegos's link. I'd love your contributions. The only requirement I have from non-Americans submitting to this issue, is I'd like for you all to pass your names through Ellis Island, in short -come up with an American pen-name. Why? I want this issue to be as Ameri-centric as possible. It's fine if foreigners write for it, but the public has to think it's all American. At least for this issue anyways. Thank you Elegos. Also, I need you to ask your Super-Sayan friend if he can do a piece on the Orthodoxy in America and the possibility of an American OC as well as why it would be .... better then the current Protestant infestation. If anyone wants to do a piece on Huey Long and his ""Every Man a King"" ideology that'd be cool. I actually have an idea for a graphic I'd like to do for it."
"For back story im in the eight grade, play percussion, etc. My buddy is in percussion with me and I think he might be a national socialist. Reasons include: he owns and loves to read mein kampf, is very nationalist and dislikes neocon or republican politics, has made statements about gassing the kikes, lurks on iron march and plenty of others. I have straight up asked him and he says he respects NS and Hitler. Just wondering if you guys might know any questions to test him to see if he is real or one of those wanna be edgy types. Also any of you had similar experiences where i friend you didnt know was fascist actually was?"

Here's the kick in the teeth: Last week, I was moved to ""Save the Children"". Now I collect for starving niglets. My job is now to tell people, that 19.000 nigger-kids die from starvation every day - AND PRETEND IT'S A BAD THING!!!"

"I am not whining about racism, I am exposing Jewish racism. Jewish racism is only based on their religion. Pro-white scientific racism on the other hand is reasonable. Jewish racism claims all non-Jews are animals in human form, this is not backed up by science. Scientific racism claims niggers are still ""humans"" but they are subhumans not animals in human form, this is backed up by science. I bet many rabbis preach that all the children of Noah on the ark were Jews and gentiles were animals as gentiles are animals in human form. I do however think about it I am sure the Jews want gentiles to follow their laws. The Jewish religion is about the Jews ruling over gentiles. The Talmud sees ""righteous gentiles"" in the same light Christians see ""righteous pig"". Christians often own livestock. ""Righteous gentile"" is the equivalent of house nigger. Many whites in the old days had black slaves and had the same attitude towards their slaves as the Talmud does towards ""righteous gentiles"". I hate the Christian and Muslim religions as well. The Jewish religion teaches ""Enslave the goyium"" when the Muslim and Christian religion teach ""Convert the non-believer"". Christian fundamentalism is practically dead. The Muslim world is full of Islamic extremists but at least these extremists do not have nearly as much power as the Jews do. Chabad-Lubavich is the largest Jewish organization in the world and it preaches that Yahweh created gentiles to be servants for the Jews. The Talmud is in the genetics of the Jewish people. By following the Jewish religion for hundreds of years they evolved into a demonic race via natural selection. If it was not for the Talmud the Jews would not be as genetically corrupt as they are now."
"Yeah, why do you have a profile picture of Vidkun Quisling? He was Norwegian, not Swedish. You're clearly oblivious to what they've been doing since they united in 2016. Give us a straight answer. Do you wanna gas kikes or not? You don't have a problem with semites or tree-worshippers? Geez... You're probably a massive faggot who fucks dudes in your home. Do you choose the bog or the noose?"
"Typical leftist autistically screaming ""THEY ARENT INFERIOR THEY HAVE RIGHTS TOO DONT OFFEND"" just makes it even more obvious, that they are inferior groups, whoever they may be, muslims, niggers, etc. This being offended on someone else's behalf is like that one thing you just don't mention in a social setting. Leftists are autistic and have no gut feeling for social settings. They're just as spergy in a political context."
"Wrong answer, stop being a Cuckservative it hasn't gotten anybody anywhere in the world. Forget your little individual feelings because they won't do you any good and hold you back in the long run. Jews don't have feelings for anybody, but themselves which is clear as they're destroying our European culture, our heritage, our traditions, our way of life etc. Telling them to leave in a week, well that's as realistic as Hitler killing 6 million yiddle diddles. Deporting Jews doesn't work it's been tried for hundreds of years throughout many different nations. They're parasites and the only way to get rid of a parasite is to destroy it. Burn it, gas it, shoot it, drown it whichever you prefer."
"Either way, I do not care about Allah because it is unlikely any god exists anyway. (Allah is not why Islam is idiotic. Islam is degenerative for other reasons). But, if Allah was always a monotheistic god, then why was it worshiped with Al-Qaum (god of war), Dhul Halassa (future seer), Wad (god of love), Manaf (god of women and menstruation), and other gods?"
"Cooperation of this extent is what lead to liberals saying that Muslims are ok and that they should be invited to rape, rob, and kill Europeans. I am not sympathetic in this instance, I apologize. They want someone to clean their dishes? I have a better idea, maybe they are anti-Zionist liberals (as many liberals are) who think the evil Jew is oppressing the hostile natives in the Middle East. So why not feel sorry for them and let them into your country. And then be surprised when crime goes through the roof. I am glad you are not in government in Europe. I do not know if you are a bad person, I will assume you are probably a nice guy. But crime is evil and wrong. You may be sympathetic to cooperation with people who beat European women, but I am not. Difference of opinion I suppose. Reading nonsense like that makes me want to get on my hands and knees and pray to Jesus Christ."
RETARD JIHAD IS COMIN DOWN
What are your views on the Jews and fags? Do you think we can achieve Total Victory using the political system against our enemies?
"A Dutch judge has just decided that an old WWII bunker built by the Wehrmacht will retain the status of monument that was awarded to it last year. https://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/rechter-akkoord-met-monumentale-status-nazibunker-amstelveen~a4536508/ The bunker was built in a residential neighbourhood in 1943 to shelter German army officers that lived there, using stones from a church tower on the opposite side of the street that was taken down (so it couldn't be used as a reference point by allied pilots). All other bunkers were demolished after the war except this one. It was leased to the youth group of the above-mentioned church to use as a club house, which they did until 2008. After several years of neglect, last year the municipality suddenly decided to raise it to the status of monument, restore it, and preserve it for posterity. Immediately Jewish groups started to kvetch about it in the media, how it was an outrage and stuff. Funny as hell, since many ordinary folks were annoyed by this. The kikes started a lawsuit, as they wanted its status retracted and the thing demolished, but now the judge has decided that the bunker will retain its monument status and the municipality has reserved €150.000 for the renovation of 'the nazibunker'. Too bad they're planning to use it for 'educational purposes' (take a guess), but at least the kikes were frustrated in their plans for once and it'll still exist, which is good."
"I assumed it wasn't 4chan directly, but probably Stormchan /new/. OP: I'm not a huge fan of Islam or most Middle Eastern people in general, but like most others that have posted I like to see fascism from different view points so I will definitely be reading your posts. So, welcome!"
"Billions as in plural? I doubt it would reach that many. Oh yeah, Islam does not exist either, just like nukes. You guys can't prove it so I'm right."
"As a Latter-Day Saint, I can say that LDS members would work well with the Government, they worked well with the Third Reich, they where on key with the Führer about Alcohol, and Tobacco. And in the Book of Mormon, Jews are not praised in the sense put fourth by the folk here, the Book of Mormon talks about how the Jews are a Rough necked people and would suffer because of it. Mormons have complex beliefs not exactly stupid when you see all the moving peaces. The Under Garments are not special (In the sense of Magic), they are a Way for use to remember our covenants with God, same way some Christians may wear a Cross. And how can one say Mormons are against technology? When Mormons have had a huge part to play in many Technological developments."
"If there are less then 100 true followers of christ what was the point of spreading the religion across the world anyways? just to nab those 100 few? seems very inefficient to me and if anything proves the weakness of your followers. Islam is also very good at spreading and it originates from the same place. is islam more valid than paganism, hinduism, buddhism and every other faith down the line that didnt spread as far then? let me go laugh and if the validity of a religion is not based on how many followers it has or how far it spread then why bring up that point in the first place? Of course why would you discuss your own religion? You have everything you need in your little book. ""I like how christians and catholicfags talk more about muslims than muslims themselves"" what weak arguments, this is fit for youtube or /pol/ alright you want me to start discussing paganism then? what do my fellow IM users think of stoicism and aurelius? i would actually prefer a shift in conversation"
"Absolutely. I agree with the article in the Into Materials entitled, ""There Are No Good Jews"". Being a Jew is not a religion, it is an identity. It goes to the core of who they are and therefore by necessity defines them. I believe they are as Ric Flair is known for, the dirtiest players in the game. They use their influence and peddling on all sides in order to get their goals met and obtain and discard ""allies"" at whim, using them only in so far as they are working with them for their ultimate goal. In an odd way, you can almost respect their relentless resolve to succeed, except their success leads to the undermining and destruction of our movement. Since the article mentions the ((solution)) to the Jews problem, I must confess I have not decided where I fall on that. I am reminded of the movie Conspiracy in which once the ((solution)) was brought up the argument turned to who would and would not be a Jew. I do not feel this way, as for me a Jew is a Jew regardless of how much blood is running through their veins. My issue would be that of a total ((solution)). While they cannot be trusted, and history has shown that dealing with them is problematic, perhaps their is a way to make use of them in some form of forced physical labor or menial tasks. Regarding homosexuality, I view it as a perversion of nature that must either be dealt with through counseling, medical intervention or total removal from society. The argument that people are born that way just does not ring true to me. Nature has provided us the means of reproduction and the drive to do so. Of course, sex can just be for good old fashioned fun as well, between a man and a woman, but for homosexuality to exist strikes me as a willful aberration of the way we are made."
"Happy to be here, Age: 21 Profession: Student studying history and work managing logistics for an interstate moving company. Country: America/Dixie Political history: I was ""red-pilled"" after living for a few years in Germany during my adolescence. Seeing the absolute scorn with which the German people were treated with by the immigrants that came in and the shame Germans had of their history and their people really solidified what I've come to identify as National Socialism. Though, at the time I'd probably just told you I was ""Right."" Reasons for joining: I'm tired of the jewification and degeneration of many WN and ""Alt-Right"" communities to and thought it was finally time to join an unapologetically, pure, Fascist/National Socialist board. Skills: As I alluded to above - I'm pretty good at managing logistics but I've got basic survival skills and outdoors knowledge as well. If we ever end up in a race war in Dixie I can point out edible plants. Interests: Art, Philosophy, History, Classical Music"
"Interestingly interestingly enough, in Serbo-croat our slang term for gays is ""peder"". I agree. Such a beautiful thing, but she acts like a robot. Amazing how some feminists are so caught up in ""muh soshul justiss"" that they don't realize Islam is a threat to Western women. Reminds me of a feminist 'World Religions' teacher I had who said something like: ""If Canada became like the next Saudi Arabia(because of mass immigration) there would be nothing wrong with that"" No joke. It's willful blindness."
"Not really; I think your Catholic bias is showing a bit. I don't particularly like Fred Phelps and co. methods of protest, his work history (civil rights lawyer... in his words, for easy money.. I'm not particularly fond of lawyers anyway though), or his entire theology, but on most principles he is correct. I particularly like their written articles on God's hatred and the design of their websites in general, it certainly gets the backs up of the humanist Christians, Jews, degenerates and their enablers. It calls their actions into question and deflates their egos. The WBC certainly serve their purpose, even if they're not entirely on mark. The only issue that fascists and like minded people could really take issue with is their anti-patriotism and I actually think that's a good thing; as a nationalist I don't feel the need to defend and excuse the current and past wrong doings of our leaders under the guise of ""patriotism"", I fight for what my nation once was and what it could be once again, not the current order. I have no unconditional love for a nation that champions the rights of fags, sells its inheritance to foreigners and works against god. WBC are quick to call out hypocrisy, degeneracy and tolerance; people don't like the fact that they tell it how it is written, that they're going to hell if they don't repent and carry on allowing it, it offends peoples' sensitivities and egos. I probably wouldn't be in your face as much as they are but it's the truth. They're master trolls and they're the best at showing up the hypocrisy of so-called ""1st amendment"" defenders and Libertarians. Freedom of speech for everyone except Westboro Baptist Church. They should be the best friends of any sincere and right-wing Christian. By all accounts I've heard from people that went to spend time with them, they're actually a nice and caring family with a strong bond amongst each other. Now apparently that's evil while queer adoption and indoctrination in self-destructive leftism isn't. If you were to implement biblical law and values and shun sin I bet WBC would be the biggest nationalists going. The moment I saw one of their notorious signs, all I could say was ""FUCK YES!"" it was refreshing to see people who weren't going to just accept it. Here are some more of their websites which I love: http://godhatesfags.com/ http://www.godhatesthemedia.com/ - very good one http://www.signmovies.com/ http://www.jewskilledjesus.com/ http://www.priestsrapeboys.com/ (Catholics won't like this one for obvious reasons) http://www.americaisdoomed.com/"
"Jews: Check my avatar. Queers: Most of them are either Paedophiles or diseased (AIDS etc). If we mean to protect White children, they must be removed from society. Religion: Any religion which ignores the realities of the racial struggle is valueless. I despise Islam - I mean WTF its founder was a paedo. Like to find out more about Odinism. Violence: Aryans have the right to defend themselves and ensure their racial survival. The West: Currently decadent (like Weimer) and infested by inferior races. The 3rd Reich showed how a corrupt society could be cleansed and made strong again."
"To be perfectly honest, what the Russians Soviets did to the Germans (see: Flight and Expulsion of Germans: 1944-1950) was worse than what the Germans did to the Jews even if the 6-million number is accurate. So the focus on the Holocaust is fucked either way. I don't really see a point to this thread, all it brings out is the ""muh Holocaust"" people along with the ""Jews are Goblins"" people. Both equally distasteful."

We don't care what you ask for, we are telling what it is and we'll drag anyone through the dirt to make them realize they wallow in dirt and if they kick violently and refuse to learn then we'll leave them in the dirt. You're not doing jack shit of that, you are instead literally leading people to repeat the same mistakes that have lead to dead end inaction for generations, it's actually WE who provide that education and growth for people, difference we don't pussyfoot around about it, we apply pressure because we want to see if someone is legit or not, if they are legit then telling them ""fuck you"" when they fuck up won't actually drive them away. Nobody got time for you to motherly nurture up people who won't actually commit to real action, you are shooting yourself and the Struggle at large in the foot with this crap. There is only one way: You smack the retard out of those who are just misguided, you slap the actual retards until they go away, because we don't want them in the Struggle to begin with. Again I say: you didn't fucking read Rockwell. He said that the only way the Right-wing will be united is if it is CONQUERED and FORCED into unity and a steel backbone is DRIVEN into it at the expense of the hobbyists and frauds and their fragile egos and feelings. THAT is the only way to truly unfuck the American movement situation, NOT another fucking campfire kumbaya. You already have a movement, you're instead trying to make a coalition - those kill movements, read Mein Kampf. More proof that you never read Rockwell. He wasn't a capitalist, he stood for productive enterprise and opposed it being conflated with capitalism. You're a fraud each time you try and say jack shit about Rockwell. ""Capitalism is the naked worship of money, not as a tool, but as an idol!"" ""Our people have been conned into lumping our own, honest system of ""productive enterprise"" with the dishonest, rotten swindle of Jewish usury dressed up as ""Capitalism,"" and then being forced to defend the immoral and rotten result. Thus the Jews have us worshipping their own thievery, because, we are told (and we believe), we are ""capitalists!"" "" -George Lincoln Rockwell, White Power, Ch7 (Friends of the Captain) You are literal scum for saying this and shouldn't be allowed to call yourself a National Socialist. Rockwell is one of the greatest NS champions of all time, if one actually looks at him from a viewpoint of NS virtues. Which virtues are you using though? Bullshit and further proof you never read Rockwell OR Hitler. Also just the fucking prideful CONCEIT at this point. You seriously believe you invented the fucking wheel, the default idea most all people go to and yet YOU think you are the FIRST to try, when in reality you are the LATEST ONES to do it. What is your measure of success? Having signed a meaningless piece of larp-paper? Holding a rally with people from these groups? Yeah no, that's what we are doing. All you've done is literally IGNORE what Hitler, Rockwell, Pierce, Mason and many other NS champions have taught. Again I say: you're a fraud. So you'll gladly take in ANYONE. You have Vanguard Anime in there, your claim is void. Who never read Hitler or Rockwell and says USA has no virtuous NS leaders to look up to. I say you're a fraud, and I'll keep doing that to anyone who dares claim to know shit when its clearly self-evident that they haven't even read what NS leaders and champions of the past had written and passed down to us. &gt;focusing on cheap talk Appropriate. What must be refined is understanding, once a person comprehends the worldview they'll know how to express it, and if they want to refine it thereafter &gt;reading how other NS champions expressed it will do them wonders. Everyone who isn't expressly NS/Fascist IS an enemy, that is a fundamental fact, people coming to us to try and become NS/Fascists get their chance, but once its clear that they are incapable of learning or their character is lacking they are removed, those who try to ""ally"" with us while maintaining their own flawed views must be regarded as enemies. God gave us innate nature, some people have the inborn character that is compatible with NS virtues and others do not. Nobody becomes NS, they only discover that they had always been NS. Your ""NS is just something you can learn"" is yet another point that contradicts the fundamental elements of the NS worldview, which is all about innate nature, be it of race, spirit or character/mind/soul."
"Timothy McVeigh was a psychotic gun nut who read the Turner Diaries, but didn't really believe anything other than the government is getting too powerful. The point of Jewish control and degeneracy went right over his head. He then bombed a federal building with low level civilian workers in it, accomplishing nothing for his point. The media likes to paint him as right wing and one of us to make us all look like crazy psychos. He wasn't one of us, he was most likely a libertarian, didn't know anything about what we actually stand for, and just picked up a copy of a book written by one of us for some reason, thought the message was ""Big government is getting too powerful"" (I don't deny our government is doing things it shouldn't, but that wasn't the main point of the Turner Diaries, and McVeigh obviously failed to see it), and then he though the best was to combat the government is to do a lone wolf attack on a low level government office.

"Part 2: On the Jews and Hebrews By: Akhnaton, Florian Geyer. If Jews are our principal enemy, if they are the ones who are responsible for so many ills that plague us today, how can you fascist Christians follow a religion that is so deeply rooted in Judaism? This is a question that a Christian fascist encounters often, and to answer it, we need to look at what exactly Judaism is, and who and what Jews are. So let’s start at the beginning then. In the beginning, God made the first humans. He didn’t want to create some kind of robot that follows given instructions like a mindless automaton, so He gave them free will, he made them able to choose whether to follow his Law or not. How could their loyalty to God be of any worth if they didn’t even have an ability to rebel? So He gave them that ability, and gave them a simple command; and they broke it. They rebelled against God’s Law and his Divine Order, they rebelled against the One who created them in his own image, even though they existed only through and because of his Grace. Their rebellion severed their ties to God, and their sin left quite a lasting effect on their souls. Their own nature became fallen, tainted, it became alienated from God and they were no longer able to dwell in the abode of God, eternal life in Lord’s Grace became impossible for them, and they were doomed to a wretched mortal life. This one sin, changed the entirety of human nature and convicted the fledgling mankind to eternal damnation. But God, in his infinite Love and mercy, decided to fix this. A Divine Plan was formulated, for a special event, a ritual that will counteract the effects of the Fall, a ritual that will serve as kind of a new creation though a New Adam, and return mankind to its proper path. Even though humanity did fall, people could still be loyal to God, to which He responded in kind. At the earliest time in human history, He instituted the practice of sacrifice. People would sacrifice animals in His name, for His blessings and to be brought closer to Him. At first, all of humanity carried with them the memory of God, but as time went on and people spread over huge distances, this memory became diluted, and while some elements of this primordial unity remained in many of the world’s religions, they became corrupted to the point that they were no longer valid. Sacrifices continued all over the world, but they were not legitimate before God, as people started worshiping all kinds of animals, natural forces, demons, and other created things instead of God Himself. But small pockets of proper Tradition remained here and there, and one of them was in Chaldea, in the family of Abraham. Being one of the very few who stilled kept the undiluted faith, and being a very just man, Abraham was chosen by God to help preserve this faith through his descendants, and he was told by God to go and settle into a new land, where his descendants could thrive. After some trials and tribulations, God wanted to test Abraham’s faith, and asked him to sacrifice his son Isaac to the Lord, and as Abraham decided to do so, an angel of God stopped him as God was pleased with his faith, and promised him that his descendant shall be numerous, and that he will have the honor that through his seed the great Divine Plan will come to fruition. Abraham would end up being the father of many nations, but the progeny of his son Isaac would be the line that carried on the proper faith. Isaac would become father to the twins Esau and Jacob, who would engage in rivalry over their birthright and the inheritance of the covenant promised to their grandfather and father. Esau, older twin, would eventually sell his birthright to Jacob, and would later be renamed by God to Israel, meaning one who wrestles alongside God. He will have 12 sons, who would father the 12 tribes of Israel. Even though they were blessed with the monumental historical task of being the sole keepers of the faith in God, the sons of Israel were already having difficulty in living up to that task. Power struggle began among his sons, and his favorite son, Joseph, ended up being sold to Egyptian slavers by his own brothers. In Egypt, God gave Joseph the gift of interpreting dreams, and this helped Joseph get freedom and become the pharaoh’s right hand man. A few years later his brothers came to trade with him, and recognizing that they’ve repented and became better men, asked them to move in with him in Egypt, which they did alongside their aging father. Across several generations they multiplied in Egypt and became a nation of their own, but Egyptians perceived them as a threat, and forgetting the great tasks Joseph completed for Egypt, gradually enslaved the descendants of Israel. The Jews suffered a lot under Egyptian tyranny, and cried out to God to liberate them from this. The Lord answered their prayers, and Moses was born among the Israelites. He eventually became their spiritual leader, and with the help of God, lead them out of Egypt. They came across Mount Sinai, where God called Moses to climb its peak and receive the Law. There, God gave Moses the Ten Commandments, among many other religious and secular laws. This marked the beginning of a special covenant between God and the nation of Israel. They became the people of God, specially chosen by Him to receive and preserve his Law, until the Divine Plan was to be completed. This Law however was not the fullness of God’s Law, but was part of the teaching process through which God guided humanity from their fallen state to the final fulfillment of the Law that was yet to come. The established sacrifices were there for blessings, bringing people closer to God and atonement, where the sins of the one making the sacrifice would be transferred to the sacrificial animal and washed away. While this could wash away some sins, their souls were still fallen and barred from partaking in God’s Grace and dwelling with him after death. The Israelites themselves however, were to struggle more and more in their efforts to live up to this destiny. As Moses was receiving the law on Sinai, the Israelites crafted a Golden Calf and abandoned God, and were later punished for this. They also whined and complained against their leaders and God. For all of this, they were barred from entering their promised land and wandered the desert for 40 days. After that they passed the river Jordan and settled into the land allotted to them by God, which was named Israel. They began also to be known as Hebrews, meaning those who travel through, or cross over. Eventually a Kingdom was established for the Hebrews, and King (((((((((((Solomon))))))))))) built the First Temple at the same place where Abraham tried to sacrifice Isaac. The Temple was the central piece of the Hebrew religion, and sacrifices would take place there. The Temple and the Tabernacle that served the same purpose before the Temple’s construction, were foreshadowing the establishment of the Church that would come later. They would continue to fail in their task quite a lot, general decadence and abandoning God for some foreign idol became commonplace amongst them. God started sending them Prophets to set them back on the right path, but they would have only short lived success as the Hebrews would quickly go back to their standard ways. The Prophet Hosea describes Israel as an “adulterous woman.” Many of the Prophets also talked about the coming of an anointed figure, a Messiah, the one who would bring glory to Israel and through whom would be fulfilled the promise given to Abraham that all of nations would blessed through him. After a few monarchs the Kingdom was split in two, the northern Israel and southern Judah. Kingdom of Israel would fully switch to pagan sacrifices, while Judah would some just kings but also a good amount of godless ones. For this, God would punish the Northern Kingdom, which was conquered by the Assyrians in 733BC. The remaining Kingdom of the Judah, in the south, would be punished in kind for it’s own transgressions.being conquered by the Babylonians in 605BC. The result was the whole of Israel being taken as slaves and brought to Babylon, with their Temple in Jerusalem destroyed along with the city. After 70 years they would be allowed to return, upon the ascension of Cyrus the Great, and became vassals of the Persians who had conquered Babylonians. They rebuilt the Temple, and began codifying their oral laws, fearing that they might be lost of a similar event was to take place. Alongside with the scrolls written at the time of Moses, these would become what we know as the Old Testament. In 334BC, Alexander the Great conquered the Persian Achaemenid Empire and died without a strong heir, leading to his generals establishing their own kingdoms throughout his conquered territories. The land of the Hebrews came under the dominion of the Ptolemaic dynasty ruling from Egypt, and they fared well under them. The Greek kings didn’t bother them and even took interest in their religion, leading to a creation of a Greek canon of Hebrew texts, famously known as the Septuagint, or LXX. This wouldn’t last long as the Seleucids conquered Israel and tried to enforce their religion and culture on them, forcing them to speak Greek and worship Greek gods, with Antiochus IV Epiphanes even defiling the Hebrew temple. A Hebrew revolt lead by the Maccabees broke out and they managed to win independence and maintain a sovereign dynasty until the Roman conquests. In 63 BC Pompey Magnus invaded the Hebrew Kingdom and made it a puppet of Rome. Desiring liberation, the Hebrews began to wait with high anticipation for the coming of the promised Messiah, seeing in him a hero who would lead a revolt against Rome and make Israel free and glorious again. Various political and spiritual movements gained prominence at the time. The largest of these were the Pharisees and the Sadducees. These groups would come to promulgate lot of banal superstition in their teachings, and while being very dedicated to the Law, they viewed it in a very literal and profane sense, focusing too much on its wording and ignoring much of its spirit. They followed the Law, but their souls were dead and they were themselves very corrupt and hypocritical. They all vied for power and struggled against the Romans, waiting for the Messiah to come. Many rebel leaders would claim that they are the Messiah, but they all turned out to be false. God would eventually send them the Messiah, but He would not be what they expected. They expected in him a glorious general in the image of Joshua, David, Maccabees and others, someone who would establish a political kingdom with them in charge, and bring again material prosperity to Israel. But it was not meant to be, as the time had finally come for the Divine Plan to be executed, for that act that would counteract the Fall itself, the time had come for the most important event in the history of mankind. The Messiah would not be some blessed man or a Prophet, but the Second Person of the Holy Trinity, the Divine Logos, who would incarnate as a man, named Jesus and called Christ. As the old law was not the full law but only a teaching law, Christ started preaching the law in its fullness, as He was preparing to complete His task. He preached to many, but the established parties were too entrenched in their superstitions and hypocrisies to understand His message. He preached that the fulfillment of the promise was not a materially prosperous earthly kingdom but that He is opening a path to undo the very fall of the first man, and to lead humanity back into paradise. The kingdom that was promised was spiritual and eternal, it was life everlasting in God’s Grace. While they were unable to comprehend and accept this, Christ’s movement grew and the ruling rabbis slandered Him before the Romans, and demanded his arrest and execution. This would happen, but through this, his task, and the great Divine Plan would be completed. He was arrested, tried and crucified, but His death served as something far greater. His death was a sacrifice, one great final sacrifice to end all sacrifices, a ritual to undo the very fall of mankind. Through His death the sins of the world were washed away, and the fall of mankind was atoned before God. As He rose from the dead on the third day, he shattered the very force of death and through Him all of human nature was renewed, and eternal life in Him was once again possible. He established the Holy Sacrament of Eucharist, which is a ritual through which one takes part in His sacrifice, as His sacrifice is eschatological present in all of space and time, as He is. With this, the Mosaic Law, the institution of sacrifice, and the Temple, were made obsolete as they were fulfilled in Him. Part 2 When Jesus Christ was crucified on Calvary, the Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 27 verse 51 informs us “51 And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom; and the earth shook, and the rocks were split;”. If we understand why the curtain of the temple was rent asunder, we will understand why the Jews are as they are. The temple curtain separated the Holy of Holies, where the presence of the Lord resided from the rest of the temple. This tearing is the sign of the supersession of the New Covenant over the Old. With the sacrifice of Our Lord on the cross, this new covenant was established. Christ himself acted as both High Priest and sacrificial offering, and in his blood was established a new spiritual order, a new alliance, covenant between him and his people Israel. With the inauguration of the New Covenant, and the rejection of Christ by the Jews, Israel became a new people. Indeed, their rejection is central to understanding why they behave the way they do. As E. Michael Jones outlines in his Jewish Revolutionary Spirit, when Pilate presented the mob of the Jews the prisoners of Jesus and Barabbas, promising to free one, they chose Barabbas. The Gospel of Mark, chapter fifteen, verse seven informs us as to Barabbas’ character “One of the prisoners at that time was Barabbas, a revolutionary who had committed murder in an uprising.” The Jews rejected Christ, both before Pilate and at their Sanhedrin council. Rather than choosing the Logos, the Cosmic Order, they chose revolution. They chose revolt against God in the same way their spiritual Father, Satan, has. With this rejection of the Logos, no longer was membership in the nation of God, Israel, (from Hebrew Yisra’el “he that striveth with God”) restricted to the ethnos of the Hebrew people, the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. In this way, the Old Covenant was superseded in the New. This was, and is, central to the orthodox Christian worldview. This is the very reason the Apostles preached to the gentiles, the reason Christians don’t have to keep Kosher, or to circumcise their young. As Saint Paul says in the tenth chapter and fourteenth verse of his letter to the Hebrews “For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.“ It is because the New Covenant is in our hearts, by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. It is because our blood sacrifice has been offered on Calvary, and at every Mass unceasingly is Christ in his Body and Blood is offered once again to the Father for the remission of sins. Many Christians today are completely unaware of these facts, and do not hold fast to this traditional orthodox doctrine. Instead, they have bought the lie which the modern Jew pedals. They correlate our curly sideburned friends to the Hebrew people of their own Old Testament, conferring on them some special place in God’s plan for salvation. This is heresy of the first order, as has already been demonstrated. But to understand why the Goyim think this, it is useful to examine the origins of Rabbinic Judaism. To understand where it comes from, one must understand the Siege of Jerusalem. In the nineteenth chapter of Luke, our Lord cries for the future of the city: “And when he drew near and saw the city he wept over it, 42 saying, “Would that even today you knew the things that make for peace! But now they are hid from your eyes. 43 For the days shall come upon you, when your enemies will cast up a bank about you and surround you, and hem you in on every side, 44 and dash you to the ground, you and your children within you, and they will not leave one stone upon another in you; because you did not know the time of your visitation.” The Siege of Jerusalem was famously prosecuted by the future emperor Titus Flavius, in 70AD. It was of exceptional brutality and viciousness. The Jewish historian Flavius (((((((((((Josephus))))))))))) provides an excellent and detailed eyewitness account, which is too detailed to quote at length, but here is a taste “Throughout the city people were dying of hunger in large numbers, and enduring unspeakable sufferings. In every house the merest hint of food sparked violence, and close relatives fell to blows, snatching from one another the pitiful supports of life. No respect was paid even to the dying; the ruffians [anti-Roman zealots] searched them, in case they were concealing food somewhere in their clothes, or just pretending to be near death. Gaping with hunger, like mad dogs, lawless gangs went staggering and reeling through the streets, battering upon the doors like drunkards, and so bewildered that they broke into the same house two or three times in an hour. Need drove the starving to gnaw at anything. Refuse which even animals would reject was collected and turned into food. In the end they were eating belts and shoes, and the leather stripped off their shields. Tufts of withered grass were devoured, and sold in little bundles for four drachmas. Titus apparently refused the laurel wreath, claiming he was enacting the vengeance of the divine. The destruction of the Temple, and the subsequent defeat of the false Messiah Bar Kokhba in the Second Jewish War(132-136AD) amounted to an antique holocaust in the minds of the survivors. It was such an abject defeat and humiliation, and desecration and loss on a scale that is difficult to imagine for us. In light of both these calamities, of the major Jewish theological cliques in the second Temple period, namely the Zealots, the Sadducees, and the Pharisees, only the later remained. The Roman procurator appointed a leading Pharisee, Yohanan ben Zakkai, as the religious leader of the Jews in the wake of the destruction of the Temple. Zakkai reformed the Sanhedrin, the same high council which had put Christ to death, which was now entirely controlled by the Pharisees. This new Sanhedrin began to focus on the synagogue, instruction Jews to donate their tithes to their local Rabbi. This dramatically expanded the power and the influence of the synagogues. After the conclusion of the Second Jewish-Roman war in 136, all the Jews were sent into Diaspora. It is at this time, several very important things occurred. The first is that the Mishnah, or the Oral Law of the Pharisees, was codified into a text. The Pharisees, now the Rabbi’s, believed you could not understand the Written Law of Moses without the Oral Law. These are the same traditions Christ warns us about in the fifteenth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew “15 Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said, 2 “Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat.” 3 He answered them, “And why do you transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition? 4 For God commanded, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him surely die.’ 5 But you say, ‘If any one tells his father or his mother, What you would have gained from me is given to God,[a] he need not honor his father.’[b] 6 So, for the sake of your tradition, you have made void the word[c] of God. 7 You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, when he said: 8 ‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me; 9 in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.’” The Mishnah is accompanied by the Gemara, which is the commentary on the Oral Law, to form the Talmud, of which so many in our circles are familiar. The new codification of the Oral Law also went hand in hand with a redaction of their own canon of scripture. The binding and authoritative canon, or set of books, for the Old Testament before the fall of the Temple had been the Greek Septuagint already mentioned. This version was widely used by diaspora Jews to study scripture, and was acknowledged everywhere as being legitimate and valid. The Jews tossed out books from their own canon of scripture, because they pointed too closely to the messianic claims of the Christians about Jesus. This religion of Rabbinic Judaism, centered around the synagogue, whose matter and constitution are composed of post-temple oral traditions is what the current religion of Judaism is, and has been for eighteen-hundred years. The religion of the Old Testament was radically different, being centered around the physical Kingdom of Israel, centered on the Temple in Jerusalem, administered by a Levitical Priesthood who offered sacrifices to God. These features, which define the religion of Moses’ descendants, are all lacking in Judaism, yet they are present in their spiritual forms in the orthodox Christian faith. This new religion which was created by the Pharisean Rabbi’s, this new Synagogue, is spoken of by our Lord in the book of the Apocalypse In the second chapter, ninth verse ““‘I know your tribulation and your poverty (but you are rich) and the slander of those who say that they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.” He promises to us, in the third chapter, ninth verse. “Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie—behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet, and learn that I have loved you.”"

"I never said I know what every Protestant believes, not once, but I did say if he knows the truth and refuses to stop his heresies and comes to the Church then he is damned to hell(Which is official Catholic Church teaching). Instead of refuting me, you resort to straw man arguments. The official teaching of the Catholic church is on my side. If they know the truth and refuse it, Catholic teaching says they are damned to hell. I'm not sorry for truly following the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church. Where have I been illogical in this discussion? I said I would work with them, but only if they are working in the nation's interests. Catholicism is unity, Protestantism is tribalism. Not at all, if they want to damn themselves to hell, so be it. If I show them the way and they refuse, then there is no reason to continue, he wants to be damned to hell. There is a New Covenant, and an Old Covenant. The Jews are supposed to come over to the New Covenant, which is the same God, but he sent his son, Jesus Christ, to come give us the New Covenant to save us gentiles. Since you can't understand Latin, I'll put it in English for you. ""Outside the Church there is no salvation"" We sold Indulgences, which was an abuse we corrected. They do not demand anything more than loyalty to Jesus and his Church. Jesus set up a Church for a reason. ""You are Peter"" Complete disregard for large parts of the Bible so they can have an ""easier life"" is a large difference. They don't have pure faith, they reject things Jesus set up and told us to follow. They have a tainted faith, we have real pure faith. Jesus set up his Church for a reason. Yes they are, Jesus set up his Church for a reason. They reject just more than that even. They also think they can get into heaven while using contraceptives, having pre-marital sex, etc... They do so much that goes against the Bible, and reject so much of the Bible. A heretical bible with over 5 books cut out, they are trying to damn souls to hell, that's not in Christ's interest, nor the nations. I have no issue with criticisms at all and I accept them, but you are using Aunt Sally arguments, which are fallacious. Universal truths are not universal because everyone believes in them, they are universal because they are the only truth on that subject. Thankfully the states I have in interest do not have Protestants in large numbers, but even then, there you go with straw man arguments. I have no issue working with them, but they must work in the Nation's interests. You are arguing they can do whatever they want, even if it works against the nation, and that's fine because you believe their false truths are valid. By not working in the Nation's interests it shows they don't want solidarity, and at that point I am fine with them being killed, it'll not be my issue and I'll have no reason to intervene."

On Hitler I'll say what we already know, valiantly took on the combined might of international jewry but he still lost sadly, but history proved him right in the end. I'm reading Mein Kampf and it's quite an intriguing read. Certainly not the most well written book but a lot of his predictions came true. I have the utmost respect for our murican comrades but most of the cancer plaguing the western world stems from there. Their country has become a mindless golem.

"Suh lil nigga, Are Cubans white now What a useless major Yeah no one cares, do you lift? Define Fascism Are you even White? Yeah fuck both of these kike fucks, do you still like them? Not even close How should we deal with non-whites, the alt right, fags, Jews, and America?"
"Kek, already follow you."
"Foreword I'm itching to fill a certain gap in the forum litterature, which is a simple, clear and concise definition of fascism, which doesn't rely on complex language, esoteric concepts and symbols, or assume the reader is already quite familiar with fascist history and literature. There are two reasons I really want to do this: first, this topic comes up again and again with newer members, and a familiar yet tiresome debate ensues every time. Second, even after all I've read (and all I've written!) on the subject, I find I still struggle to think of a simple, definitive explanation of what fascism IS(rather than what it ISN'T), that would be immediately understood by someone who's totally uninitiated. Ideology VS World-view When a man is on a journey, he needs a few things to insure he'll have a good trip. He first of all needs to know where he wants to go, to have some idea of his destination, even if it's just a feeling (go where it's warmer) or a vague direction (east). He'll also need maps, which contain the knowledge that will get him to his destination. In life, a man's destination is determined by his values, and he makes tactical decisions on a day to day basis according to his knowledge or ideas, which are like his ""map"" to reality. Similarly, groups of people, who are headed in the same direction, share a common world-view, and they base their policies on an ideology. In other words, a group's world-view is the system of values by which they judge everything else and decide what their common goals are, while ideologies are the theories and models they develop to reach those goals. Destination = Value system (individuals) = World view (groups) Maps = Ideas (individuals) = Ideology (groups) Modernism VS Traditionalism There's basically infinite numbers of potential ideologies and world-views, but they all belong to one of two categories, which are polar opposites and totally irreconcilable. Those two categories are modernism (often called materialism) and traditionalism (often called idealism). In modernism, the highest good is to be comfortable and safe, while avoiding pain and danger. Everything is good or bad according to that criteria. In traditionalism, the highest good is truth and the rejection of falsehoods. Everything is good or bad according to that criteria. It's very important to note that for modernists, ideas, values and theories are *tools* to be used to attain material ends. Those things have no inherent value in themselves. If truth is in the way of feeling good, then truth must go. Inversely, for traditionalism, it is material conditions and possessions that are considered tools - used for the purpose of attaining and upholding truth. If comfort and safety are in the way of truth, those things must be sacrificed. What is fascism? Fascism is the traditional world-view, as it manifests in the modern world. This means fascism is primarily concerned with *truth*, which is to say, with objective reality. It also means that fascism is not an ideology, although fascists can employ ideologies to deal with specific circumstances when the need arises. Fascism cannot be compared with ideologies like capitalism or communism, since those are simply alternate methods to reach the same goal (ie. the greatest comfort and safety for the greatest numbers), while fascism holds a completely different goal: to make human society embody the eternal truths of the universe. Of course, since the world is a complex and mysterious place, which no one can claim to fully understand, implicit in the fascist world-view is the need to explore and experiment in order to attain a greater knowledge of the truth, which will be reflected in our laws and institutions. Inversely, the purpose of science in the modern world-view is to create gadgets for our pleasure and convenience, while uncomfortable findings are swept under the rug to allow liberal myths to go unchallenged. Tenets of fascism Ideologies like libertarianism are full of tenets, ideas that define them. For example, libertarians insist that since everyone is selfish, giving anyone a monopoly will lead to corruption. That is one of their tenets. By making a simple list of these tenets, it's possible to explain what the ideology is about quickly and easily. This is not possible with fascism, because fascism has no tenets. Indeed, fascists tend to be ""racist"", ""socialist"", ""anti-semites"" and many other things, but those are not inherent components of fascism or inherent personality traits of fascists. A fascist simply looks at the evidence and decides that reality is racist, human nature is that we are social animals, and jews have historically been a harmful influence on every society that hosted them. If it was proven the other way around, a fascist would adopt the opposite notion. As such, fascism has no hard and fast tenets, but fascists are accumulating a mass of scientific and academic evidence that is ""politically incorrect"" for modern materialist society. As individuals grow and progress on the path of fascism, they will progressively acquaint themselves with this body of evidence, and thus approach truth. Also, basic common sense and a cursory observation of nature will let anyone understand certain principles that govern the world. ""The strong survive, while the weak perish"". Such a banal notion that it barely needs saying, yet a revolutionary thing to affirm to a modernist. All of these simple principles can be learned by reading (or remembering!) the fables of Aesop, short stories written thousands of years ago and intended to teach common sense to children, yet which are now terribly ""politically incorrect"". Walking on the path of truth Being a fascist means walking on the path of truth - and this requires a weeding out of all falsehoods from our lives. This begins with the self: it is necessary to fully accept who and what we are (unlike the degenerates who reject their humanity, reject their gender, reject their race, their nation, their history, etc). As Rockwell said, you either believe in the scientific method and apply it to yourself, or you're only kidding yourself. Walking on the path of truth means learning what is our place in the world and fulfilling that position. It means understanding that everything from individuals, to nations, races and species have their place in a cosmic hierarchy. This holds true even when we're faced with the uncomfortable notion that we're not at the top of that hierarchy. When the social order reflects the natural order, which is to say that every member of society fulfills the role that is most appropriate to their nature, then that society has realized the fascist ideal. Notes This is not a final text, I intend to update this post until it's absolutely clear. Hopefully I can trim it down to a shorter length, and improve the flow of the text. Also, I don't want this to be a dry reading, so please tell me if you found this dry and boring or hard to read. My goal is to have a post I can point newbs towards when they arrive here full of misconceptions - without blowing their minds and boring them to tears with deep philosophical ramblings. Also please indicate if there's anything missing or incorrect that I need to adjust."
"America was a great nation and in one crucial aspect still is; it's military power, hijacked by kikes or not. If only America could snap out of their shit they could easily hold the imperial flame alive and drive the traitors out from the West. Let's be honest, if Europe is going to be free from this Marxist crap we either need America to topple the kikes or whole of Europe to plunge into chaos roughly at the same time. Otherwise it will be an invitation for either Russia or US to ''liberate'' (and they will do it anyway when it happens, but then we will have a chance to resist them at least)l."
"I lived in a ''troubled area'' for a while (4-5 years or so) and know how the somalis, arabs, kebabs and other mudskins act when they are bought to a civilized (if you can call Sweden that anymore) country. Made me think that maybe something else than ''experiences'' seperates the white man from the muds. These people act as greedy as the jew, desperately want more wellfare money for no reason other than ''muh molah XDDD''. If they really flee a warzone you'd imagine they would be more grateful. Meanwhile the politicans blow off the jew."
but the bible is gay
"Apply those ideas and every single fucking third world worker is dead, and thank god. That's why they're not capitalistic. Conglomerations on lines of superior traits have always stamped out divided and competing reactionaries; that is how capitalism overtook the world and that is how National Socialism will overtake the jews. derp. merkuh isn't a nation, it's a sewer burn it to the ground #rekt #spic /thread"
"Violent insurrection? Only 1/3rd of the US population at the time fought, the others either fought FOR the British or just stayed neutral. The US was born because a bunch of rationalist inspired wanks found an excuse to fight a rationalist liberal constitutional monarchy. Nations are formed by a common people moved by their blood to conquer, grow and seed the soil. Some of the colonists might have fought for such an ideal but there were also others who fought for money and abstract notions of liberty. We're not enlightened, we're just not blinded by American patriodardism. Your opinions are rooted on a false premise. That the US is salvageable as an entity. It is not, because the US was built on ideals that are the complete antithesis to what Fascism strives for. You'll need to read the materials, its mandatory if you earnestly want to understand what Fascism is. The truth is a cosmic principle, it is given by God. It is natural law. Tradition is the means by which a certain race aspire to that truth. You can notice this by how many traditions believe in the sin of homosexuality or race-mixing for example. No matter if pagan or Christian or whatever, there is a certain worldview that we hold to. One that denies the suicidal beliefs of the enlightenment. The anti-life ideas of the Jew. ""All men are created equal"". This was said by one of America's founders and it is among the most anti-traditional and most anti-traditional notions ever. And I agree, that's why the American Futurism workshop even exists. There is no Fascist way to power for any American wanting to preserve the USA. The United States of America is at its root nothing like any other state. If you destroyed the German constitution you will still have the German people. China has had dozens of governments but the concept of China still exists. The Civil War almost destroyed the idea of the USA, the thought a state can democratically elect to leave the Union is alien to any nation with a blood and soil character. The disintegration of the US is the best thing to happen to any American because it allows them to truly create a distinct American racial identity instead of being chained to piece of toilet paper like the Constitution. How many states can survive without federal aid? California would be fucked, the Midwest would die. The only states that can survive by its own is Texas and the New England states. This paragraph highlights the divide between American patriots and American fascists. This is why I said that a Dixie Fascist Nation or a Pacific Northwest Nation can exist. You think of government while I'm talking about race-culture. There is no race-culture that dominates the US. It's Yankees, Dixies, Californians and etc. The South has a distinct race-culture. Even when it's infested with niggers there is still a common volkgeist. If the Civil War was won by the Confederates than you could have seen possible organic nations developing in North America. It began when it started. The United States was formed with the idea that a federal centralized government would play second fiddle to the power of the states. But that didn't turn out great with economy disasters and a weak sovereignty. The fact that the US had to compromise its beliefs so early shows that it was so weak. The 1920's as a specific point in time doesn't make sense because the decline happened long before that. Then use that logic and rationalism. The system of the United States is defined by its adherence to the Constitution, it was developed with checks and balances. It was meant to be a system designed for status quo. Only a violent conflict can lead to permanent changes because eventually the left will take back power of the system and undo everything the right has done. Decades of partisan back and forth and nothing has changed. The game is rigged and the only way to win is to kick the table under. Is violence a logical means of doing it? Is it rational to think that the US government can be beat? Maybe not. But Fascism is limited by rationality. Any Fascist can enjoy their life, be hedonistic and not care at all. In this modern world we can access anything we want, so why are Fascist so discontent? Why can't we enjoy all the sick pleasures like every other normal person? It's because we are disgusted and horrified by the degeneracy rife in this world. The moral decay of civilization and the degradation of our races. These are not rational feelings born of the mind but born from the soul and heart."
"Hello I am new and when I say new within the past few months I have torn down over 30 years of conditioning. My background is fairly religious being I was a JW. As JW you learn the bible more so then any theologian. You are taught to argue your viewpoint using nothing, but scripture. So this is what held me back from knowing the truth. If there was any resentment or thought I had that was against what the slave god(I am able to say slave god now because of what I know now) taught I quickly dismiss it using the scriptures, convincing myself to totally submit to slavery or to Jehovah a god created out of the slave trade(especially knowing that the slave owners are our favorite people the chosen ones). I started my journey with my ethnic friends crying about black lives and how their culture have been misappropriated. They were nagging enough so I decided to look into it for my friends. As I looked I came across the holocaust and then I wondered what else I was lied to about. I read Mein Kampf and that changed everything. Everything that did not fit or I had a disdain for and just dismiss as pride, disobedience, or just rationalize it as so because of this or that I was able to tear down my conditionings from realizing everything in Mein Kampf was ridiculously true today as it was in that time. I have always been against the grain kind of guy and I did follow Alex Jones in my early adulthood so I did know of a lot of the problems, but there was no rhyme or reason to it. After reading Mein Kampf everything just fit and all the missing pieces were found. One thing Alex Jones keeps saying, “it's the elites,” but even though they had no ties with another other then money I soft question it. Why would all these people betray everyone they knew for a different group of people? Like the bilderburg group, does that mean if I become rich I will go to one of the meetings and come out looking to genocide my own race? No, now I realize I have been condition to advocate the death of my race by one group of people the Jews aka the slave traders. I have fought for equality and argued for every group of people, but my own. I have even unwittingly hated my own skin because of the teachings in school, media, and from people. Everything I have believed in has been one lie after another. Now I am learning and plotting. I know there is an evil out there and now that I can see them clearly they will be defeated. For now I learn not to stimulate myself, but to win this war. My skills are: I have a high level of knowledge electrical engineering, I served on a nuclear sub for 5 years. I am still in the same field today. I am more into building technology for better domestic life and military application."
"I just realised I double posted, so I have already sacrificed three Jewish souls to Odin to protect me from the wrath of Slavros"
"You do realize Muslims practice circumcision as well as generally foster a pedophilia-tolerant culture, right? Also what Alex said. This whole traditionalist pro-Islam view is retarded because: 1). It is spergy fetishization, like most ""traditionalists"". 2). It seemingly glosses over the fact that it's not Islamic mass conversion we're dealing with, but mass immigration of non-Europeans of which a lot happen to be Islamic. If you're going to throw out the European criteria for our nationalism then what the fuck is the point? Now I am indeed critical of the ""Islamophobia"" movement as about half of them are pseudo/civic-nationalists fixating on Islam as a copout to vent their anxieties about potentially becoming minorities in their own countries whilst subconsciously acknowledging and accepting the anti-racist indoctrination they've internalized (""hurr it's culture not race!!!!111"", believe me I know. I was one of them.), and the others are just smart leftists and neo-cons who recognize that Islam is incompatible with liberal values. Pat Condell comes to mind. Fixating on Islam is a copout because whilst I would agree that Islamic immigrants are disproportionately more likely to cause problems due to their religion, we should oppose all non-European mass immigration, Islamic or not. Many people in the Islamophobia movement seem to be implying that if we became minorities in our own countries it would be alright as long as the majority was not Islamic. That is obviously not acceptable."
"I'm re-reading ""You Gentiles"" by Maurice Samuel. Written by a Jew who lays out the case that Jews have a fundamentally different psyche from non-Jews. I've been interested in this idea for a while because I occasionally encounter it in unrelated places. Like in the movie ""The Believer"" where the main character Daniel Balint claims that the Jews are essentially female. Yes, I know that The Believer is a work of fiction, but still, why was this written into the script? It's an odd claim that I never heard anywhere else before, and Daniel is supposed to be pretty based when it comes to anti-semetic thought. It's as if the writers believed it, or atleast knew quite a bit about the Jewish question. But back to the book, it covers the differences between Jewish and non-Jewish thought in many areas of life. Know thine enemy, maybe? You Gentiles PDF: https://archive.org/details/YouGentiles_414"
"Will check this out. I usually hate anime, but I recently began watching Legend of the Galactic Heroes, as people on /pol/ shilled hard for it. This is the episode that drew me in, its just a flashback/documentary episode about the lore, so I checked it out, and its about a far right politician that takes over the space republic and turnes into a tradical empire,and purged all degenerates. And then in the ""present times"", the tradical empire is fighting a rebel faction of corrupt shekel loving democracts in epic space battles. Apparently there are Jews in it too"
"Crusades are cool. but Catholics attacked the Orthodox. Russian and Byzantine remember it. German crusaders destroyed Balt Slavs. Crusaders to kill Muslims, not Europeans"
It's written in their program. Are you saying the Kike implanted it there?
"""the golden dawn is antisemitic just look at this horrible symbol and those flags, omg!"" Reports on the Golden Dawn are getting more biased and ridiculous by the day."
"No they're not. Muslims living in western nations are the most whiny and hypocritical shits - they appeal to liberalism and religious pluralism whenever it suits them, but turn a blind eye towards the savage customs and behavior of their coreligionists. In virtually every western nation where they reside, muslims have allied themselves to social democrats and the far left. There should be no tolerance for these parasites."
"I'm sorry that I'm being eltist on a forum meant for elitists, or that I believe games that muddle the boundary between the virtual and the physical have an adverse affect on children. Most people don't believe us when we state that there's so much power within the Jews, the establishment, or the media, you wouldn't bat an eye if I said watching films made by Jews had an adverse affect, but if I touch your precious video games you recoil, you stand aghast that someone would dare attack your addiction. These games are taking over people's lives, mine craft alone has probably ruined a generation of children and left multiple grown men with a immature state of mind thanks to the ability to become professional video gamers. And what ties into all this? You can watch fucking video games in sports channels, video gamers get sponsored by large corporations. Also you have no fucking idea what mensur fencing is you fucking peasant. It's a test of spirit and stoicism, an ancient tradition of aristocrats evolved from dueling. It's not dressing up, it's not a form of escapism like your precious Pokemon, but you wouldn't understand something that transcends your infantile mind. But please, consume emasculating alcohol, whilst hooking up with women who are only satisfying their lust for cum and material interests. If I've made any mistakes, it's probably from having just got out of the ocean after a refreshing swim in the salt water, not many Pokemon here."
"I don't speak Swedish, so no, but Finnish and Swedish party programs shouldn't be radically different. It pretty clearly states that ""demonstrating/showing their sickness/abnormality"" is criminal. So no, there's no room for ""based homos"" like Röhm. In addition to it and the anti-faggot demo in a few weeks, during like the last week we have released a bunch of articles strongly denouncing faggotry as disease spreading, jew promoted sickness, to ""celebrate"" the Pride: http://www.vastarinta.com/kansallismielinen-liike-ja-homot/ http://www.vastarinta.com/homokulttuuri-ja-juutalaislobby/ http://www.vastarinta.com/helsinki-pride-ja-setan-tarkoitus/ http://www.vastarinta.com/onko-homokulttuuri-tervetta/ Personally, I would like faggotry as a disease to be criminalized as a symbolic act, even if it were impossible to enforce. But under the proposed law Greg Johnsons and half of Counter Currents would still be drowned in a bog so I'm pretty happy tbh."
"preach bruh if there has to be one guy to be gassed right now in this moment, it should and inshallah be blackcock 13 for sure. I'm happy this has happened but I feel all we will get out of it is kosher parties getting bigger. I think everything in NS that is good, noble, and positive is in Islam except Islam is of God and NS is of men. I feel Islam can fit with any culture really but a lot of people here are stuck in this idea that they want to take down western civilization and that is bad. That is actually good because western civilization is in decline... You can't salvage it at all... it needs to be destroyed quickly. Defending western civilization is defending democracy, feminism, and faggotry. Don't do it man. Also don't forget that the kosher right nationalists hate Islam but love Israel. Islam is a good ally against jews."
"I don't think we in the west would ever marry away children, regardless of us being muslim or not. We don't believe that is right, and never have either. As for Arabia, Arabs are not European. IDC what they do there as long as it doesn't spread here. Religion should be subordinated to the people in any case. Gas the kufars, jihad now."
"I think 2-3 of my libtardiest friends deleted me on jewbook after I defended NS/Hitler/xenophobia for the first time, still see them a few times a year but they always act like we are still on very good terms, no one would ever say anything to my face Everyone that knows me knows what I'm about, parents refuse to believe I'm a nazi, just a gud boi going through a 'phase' or smth The only reactions I've ever gotten from acquaintances (at university) though were pure indifference. Word for word in my first year of university: So you believe in the supremacy of the Aryan race? Cool. That was the funniest one. Even wrote papers on 'Jewish privilege' when the assignment was either white privilege or male privilege. Showed it to some guy that always sat with me in class and it turned out he was a Jew. Awkward, haha. There was a commie chick in my second year that I was doing a project on communism with. After the initial shock wore off that I was actually a Nazi , we were sitting in the library and she tried telling me that there wasn't any difference between races and multiculturalism was some sort of natural progression. Told her to look around the library at groups sitting at tables, sure enough, races self segregated. Anyways, after a bunch of these kinds of conversations she admitted communism could never work. 1st year again, there was a club fair and I was walking around checking everything out. Run into two guys I knew through one of my friends, they are shilling for 'farthest right' political party in my province. So we started talking and after I tell them I am not interested in political parties, and that I am a fascist one of them wholeheartedly agrees with me, meanwhile Johnny McLemming goes like 'h-heh, y-yeah, fascism is g-great', still well acquainted with both of them. Anyways I have lots more stories but you get the idea, haven't ever been given any trouble"
"Sweeden better watch out, a challenger has appeared. Will it be able to dethrone the current champion and rightfully claim the title of Cuckland? Find out next time on Nation Wide Suicide. But seriously, these people don't know what the fuck they are doing as they've never had any contact with the pseudo-gypsy refugees. They are just mentally masturbating over 'MUH TOLERANCE' crap. Hopefully they will wake up after a first hand experience and before the damage gets too high. Fucking snake tongued kike media. It's not a shifting attitude, just the default attitude of those that have taken the media-fed multicuck bullshit as truth without ever experiencing it first hand. The real shift is towards anti-immigration and it is on the rise in most places that have been 'culturally enriched'."
"Because I don't spout groupthink for free points. I don't give a fuck about points. Tack a points meter on for how many Jews/nonwhites you killed, or a meter for how much real life damage you have caused against the ""system""....And that is something I will fully endorse."
"You can't get into it because it doesn't make sense unless you see democracy as the rule of the people and the state as the ultimate representation of the people that is ruled by a supreme leader that is the very manifestation of his people's will. Also you're annoying because you seem to write wall of texts without saying much and trough that generally being annoying. Stuck at the stage where one thinks you know best on everything. When someone claims to know better of a subject and make fundamental errors due to lack of understanding or lack of knowledge, the arrogance of said person thinking he would know is rather annoying. I've been on both ends of that coin so I know what I talk about here. If some retarded neo pagan would come up and say ''jesus was a gay loving faggot that died because he was too weak LOL'' I would cringe, laugh or get annoyed because said person don't have a basic understanding of the Bible. If someone who has not read Spengler insist that Spengler meant X because of Y and therefore democratic communism is the way to go, that would be retarded because I've read Spengler + democratic communism sounds faggy and autistic. If I would suddenly think to know better than an electrician on the issue of my light in my bathroom, I should not be suprised if he gets a bit grumpy. Little did you know your fedora is basically a menorah because you have not read evola~~ Banter aside. Take it easy and get to the point of why you think you're unique special view is more sane than the Evola-tipper's."

The MNIQC has officially announced that they will stop their activites after death threats and a cyberattack on their website. Looks like these guys have no guts. André Drouin would make a good leader because he is on constant surveillance from the police because of the shitload of death threats he received from islamists and antifas but he still continues his crusade against islamisation without any shame.
Islam and Judaism are the main problems. The others including the niggers are easily sorted out.
"I got to thinking while people such as Donald Trump have warranted claims to condemn Islam on the U.S campaign trail, its a tiny bit misplaced, only because this country has such as a tiny amount of Muslims actually living here, and that the only criticism should not be that it is extremely bigoted as it is a little silly. Out of the whole continent, Canadians are the ones who have slightly more say to hate kebabs. Europe, on the other hand, has a def-con level issue with Muslims, not counting the Syrian diaspora that began pouring in last year. The reason I think this issue should be prioritized over the Jewish population in all European countries is that 1. There are not as many as in the U.S and 2. Jews in Europe are more willing to leave. So what if it is primarily because they are afraid of the kebabs they let into Europe in the first place? That is why when thinking in white pan-nationalist terms, North America should really focus on the Jews, and Europe should really focus on the Muslims. The U.S has the numbers and proximity to destabilize the Jews, which would seriously hinder institutions such as Hollywood, and Wall Street. The U.S can also do the most damage to Israel in that it can pull the rug from under the foreign aid organizations like AIPAC. The US funds Israel more than any other country. Europe, as hypocritical as it may sound, needs to prioritize clamping down on immigrants. Certain members of the EU, like German government explicitly admits it wants to take in as many shitskins as possible and explicitly wants them to fuck German women, so that all warrants a little more attention. Oh, and end this no-go zone shit. In time, the skinhead muslim crossfire would make the most hardened jews would flee to Israel, and the problem would sort itself out."
"Hail to you and thanks for acceptance, I m the administrator of the algerian radical nationalist network: El Afkar El Wataniya (Nationalist Ideas) and a member of the NPAC (National Patriotic Algerian Comitee). El Afkar el Wataniya is the meeting place of all the Algerian nationalists understand modern issues of globalism threat, immigration and miscegenation. My personal political and philosophical influences are quite numerous: Evola, Robert Dun, Rene Guenon, Tomislav Sunnic, Laurent Ozon, Gabriele Adinolfi, René Binet, GA Amaudruz,William Pierce, Miguel Serrano- Corneliu Codreanu, etc ... And I registered on this forum to follow interesting discussions, because as many of you here, I think the fascists/nationalists and racialist movements must unite and face all globalists threats as the Jewish mafia, the Islamist threat, mass immigration, cultural marxism and all the plagues of the modern world.

"how effective would it be to stickercaust something like le nazi propaganda that advocates political candidates, in an effort to sway people from voting for that candidate because evil right winger nazi goyim fascists support them?"
"Ran out of thanks to give. Glad to hear you're keeping up the fight. My friend's in San cristobal, very agrarian manner of life up there, many of them nostalgic for Jiminez and his authoritarian style with an emphasis on anti-communism. Literally the only praise Chavez gets from fascists in Vz is his ""anti-Semitism"" which was pretty moderate and a typical case of Jews blowing things out of proportion."

"Our German class has a ""culture"" element and the professor actually asked what the most pressing things about German Culture are. What comes to mind. My suggestions were Industry, Philosophy, and Heritage. The most pressing and upsetting matters about Germany for the rest of the class is ""Nazism, Racism towards Immigrants, and Rammstein."" What the fuck do you guys expect? This is one of the greatest countries that ever existed being completely subverted and destroyed by the kikes and the marxists. Destruction of culture, destruction of nationalism, and the discouragement and even persecution of any patriotic or national sentiments by its people."
"It's over, I'm accepting only April now. &gt;2000 post What do I win?"
"That's the one I'm referring too - when I was there, there were no speeches, and certainly not ""hundreds"" of normies watching. I was near some Labour/Socialist people, who were phoning people to join them (I saw the Anime girls). As more people came, more insults were thrown. I never said there were fights or anything. I left after 10 minutes for a Uni meeting, but that is what I saw. I'm not lying @ਪ੍ਰੋਜਾਰਹ. @Змајевит, @Свинск, @Bucketoflemons, @Николајевић. Rights are innate, but that doesn't make them guaranteed. We must fight to attain and safeguard them, as we must fight to secure our territories from external threats and invaders, and traitors seeking to undermine it from within. Thus Jews must be stripped of all significant assets and expelled (as said above) and confined to their own territory, so that they cannot attain influence within or over other nations. Doesn't mean I respect or like Jews one bit. I know you would rather chant ""gas the kikes"" etc, and that's fine - we disagree slightly. I fully agree, well put. My stance on Jews is not to their benefit - it is to the benefit of my own nation and our allies. Also, expulsion / asset stripping is more attainable and realistic than blind extermination. It can be done incrementally (there will not be a revolutionary moment in the UK in our lifetimes, which would enable a replay of 1933 onward to occur). National Socialism isn't exactly the most modern of political ideologies either. If we could discard a political position simply because it is ""outdated"", then we'd all be fucking SJWs or something by now, wouldn't we? @Tex is correct - I'm not a fan of the British monarchy as it currently is, but I value the institution in and of itself, and the potentially powerful and positive role is can play in state governance and national culture."
"If Jews are wining we should help Muslims, if Muslims are winning we should help Jews. The goal is to make them wipe each other out."
"Hello, everyone! I'm going to try to avoid the mistakes some of those bog-worthy kikes in the showers made, in their introduction threads. Age I'm fifteen years old. I first started getting into National Socialism around last year, but well before that, in my conservative phase, I was extremely anti-faggot, anti-miscegnation (though I couldn't explain why). I am fully redpilled on the Jewish Question, and I'm more than willing to learn more about the world around me. Profession I've done off and on yardwork for our neighbors, if that counts. Other than that, I'm a fresh neet.. Country / State United States of America. I live in Michigan, specifically. Reasons for joining Reason for joining? I'm tired of lurking on internet forums without goal or purpose. I already stay cooped up in our house too much and I'm dying to get active. I already get outside and put up fliers (they don't stay up for long though..), but I want to interact with other like-minded folk. Skills As for skills, I'm decent at writing up articles and I can debate with peers fairly well. I don't have much experience with actual work, though, so for the time being, I'm probably not going to be the one to go to for those kinds of things. Interests Interests? I'm definitely an outdoors guy. I love exploring the woods out back behind our home. We live in the country, in a mostly white neighborhood (haven't seen a blackie in ages!), so I use that opportunity to do some hiking. Lots of farmland. Other than that, I enjoy whittling, swimming, fishing, and anything that lets me get hands on experience firsthand. Contact information If you'd like to contact me, you can ask me privately. I don't give out my email that easily. Any kind of projects you're working on On the note of projects, I've been trying to get into video editing (nothing noteworthy, other than one video that I put a decent bit of effort into..): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQp7S0F1Afk I noticed one of the questions people often ask here are 'what are your stances on religion?', so I'll save time for both of us. I believe Christianity is irreplaceable as the sole bearer of Western, White values. There will never be any religion to substitute it and as far as I'm concerned, most other religions are relatively inferior in overall quality, to it. Cosmotheism is an interesting concept, but unifying religion as a whole seems very pointless to me. I'm sure I can be convinced otherwise, but until then, that's just that. But, I'm non-practicing. I don't have the determination to study up on the bible, as much as I want to. I swear to god, if I got the formatting wrong on this topic, I'm going to make a dunce cap, and I'm going to wear it."
"There are rumors swirling around about another Islamic coup in the making in Trinidad and Tobago. In the 90's we had an attempted coup by the Muslims where they took control of the congress house and shot the President and it seems the Muslims want another go at it. Just last year there was a prison break involving only Muslim niggers and it is believed that it has something to do with an upcoming plan to overthrow the government. A witness has come foward and warned of another prison break, suicide bombings and an attack on the capital by a large group of Muslim niggers. Its certainly possible that ISIS fighters have come back to Trinidad and now want to wage their jihad here. Trinidad has had 140 murders this year already, the highest rate in years. I really just hope that nothing major happens before I'm able to go back there to live. It would mostly be Muslim niggers involved in any attack and that would set off riots and looting in certain parts of the country with mostly niggers involved, if this happens it can force the Indians to wake up and start doing something to protect and defend ourselves. Maybe I can go and start a HINDU DEATH SQUAD. It would suck so much if something big like this happened and then I'd be stuck here without being able to get down there."
"Why Protestantism Christianity is retarded and a Jewish invention. @Black Israelite Fixed the title for you , you almost had me there."
"You must not know much about Israel, recent Jewish history, or zionism. Are you aware that Israel itself officially brands Irgun a terrorist organization? So, your question on that is just fucking pointless. Regarding their ""change""...Irgun --&gt; Herut(founded by Menachem Begin) --&gt; Likud. Many of us know Likud as the party led by Benjamin Netanyahu, the current Prime Minister of Israel. It is a conservative &amp; zionist party, no? Here's what's funny: Israel brands Irgun a terrorist organization however allows its' ideological successors - created by the same people who led Irgun itself, no less - to take active part in their government &amp;, what's this, even lead it! Considering Menachem Begin was the sixth PM of Israel himself. Herut never dropped their militant form of revisionist zionism. You said the zionists started tracking them down &amp; condemning them(even though Herut made no real changes from the ideology Irgun, just dropped the violent confrontation), but somehow their leader got out of all of that &amp; managed to convince the entire Israeli nation that he had changed &amp; they elected him to the position of national leadership? So, basically, Israel WAS led by terrorists(not to mention terrorists that its' own people had condemned). Just ""former-terrorists."" who had changed the name of their group. Yeah. Or did he just convince everyone that a God-blessed miracle gave him salvation &amp; turned him away from his horrible terrorism? ""Hey, we're going to condemn you &amp; track you down!"" ""Wait, no, he has changed the name of his organization! Now no one will know the difference. Give him leadership over the country."" Oy vey. You jews are perhaps the most hypocritical &amp; autistic group on the planet sometimes with how far you take your own self-deceit."
"I am pretty sure those ""quotations"" are propaganda. However I do recall Khomeini was lenient on transexual freaks. I think this is because he did not have an understanding on genetics or biology. Personally I support ""Assads Pagan army"". I am an outright Pagan. I am almost as socially conservative as Al Quada. Syria protects White and semi-White Syrians from the racially inferior horde. Non-Sunni Muslims are on avarage racially superior to Sunni Muslims. Middle Eastern Christians one avarage are racially superior to both Phonecians/Maronites and Assyrians are for the most part fully to mostly Aryans. Sunni Islamism is a movement in which racial degenerates like Saudis and Somalis, Sudanese niggers are over represented. Not that I am saying all mostly Sunni nations are racially inferior to Shia Muslims, I am just saying they genrally are. Many Shias are nigger-like as well(The leader of Hezbollah for example). I googled some of those names out of curiosity. Zdenka is a female slavic name, this is more proof the Jews like to kindnap Eastern European women and rape them. LOL at Jews googling porn with Arabs. I would agree Afghanistans searches are the least disturbing but how many Afghans have access to internet? For the most part it is the wealthiest Afghans that are running these websearches."
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics_in_the_United_States This is a great article aside from the liberal butthurt, the US actually used to be pretty fucking based pre-WW2. That wave of WW2 kike refugees really fucked the country up."
Ex-Muslim's channel that was muslim only a few months ago. But different than other ex-muslim and anti-muslim channels. He discredits Islam in detail with very strong experience and through a more conservative perspective. Very much recommended. Especially for those who are disillusioned and are stupid enough to think Islam is tradical.
"And you are a woman, probably some beta niggers and jews are gonna support you on the merits of that lol."
If said wannabe nigger in JihadWaffen didn't go around saying that the killings of whites in Europe is ''Completely understandable'' I might've liked him more. Moreover he was gassed from IM. Most people also know he is a mental wreckage. The real fucking question is the accusation that he is not the only muslim in the group. How many have he ''converted'' to his autism?
"It's not as simple as all that, in the pseudo-Soviet system of Finland you don't even have to be registered group to be banned, they could practically try arresting people for simply the fact they form ""an ideological association"" by hanging out together. But yeah, no one here expected ZOG to simply fall over and hand over power? This is what you will have ahead of you, if you constitute an actual danger threat unlike the faux-revolutionaries and useful jew tools of the left. I felt pride as they singled us out as the only truly revolutionary organization in Finland. My educated guess is the pass won't ban since the argument seems to be mostly that NRM is directly opposed to ""accepted values"" and ""good manners"". There's no legal definition for those, of course, and can't be. When shit's that vague, you could use it just as well for us than against us. Commies and sodomites are against ""good manners"" as well, right? But then again, ZOG is ZOG, so one has to be prepared for absolutely anything."
"We don't need a bunch of fucking Jews within our groups in order to expand our goals. That's exactly how the Alt-Right went to complete shit. You should stop being their friends immediately. They're fucking degenerates that deserve to be gassed. Fuck America and fuck it's Judeo-Satanic culture. If you enlist in the U.S. Military, I hope you step on an I.E.D. TL;DR, Read the intro materials or go back to Stormfront/8chan/TRS."
"I meant a more liberal approach to the fascist alterntitive, not a more liberal approach to what is currently in place. Nationalising the banks and kicking out the international jewery is a better way to remove foreign influence than the tightest immigration possible."
"There isn't any consistent proof or really sensible motive for it being on purpose. The simple fact they sent rescue boats to help the survivors seriously puts a dent in any conspiratorial accusations. Any claims to the contrary have to go against that. At worst it's undetermined. Hey, I fucking acknowledge that it was a terrible accident, but whatever. It sucks just stop using it to push an autistic, whiny ISRAEL HORRIBLE narrative. It's getting old. ""wah how dare you condemn the war in iraq it's excusing the deaths of americans on 9/11"" You literally sound like that, hear me? If every Jew on earth was a cultural marxist talmudic racial supremacist that wouldn't make the USS Liberty not an accident."

The kikes have been pushing us for too long, once Israel falls we'll need to kill the rest of them. Every last Jew needs to be hung in public."
"There were plenty of mistakes that he made but he ranks along the greatest Germans and statesmen. As I've said before, a final battle between Russia and Germany was inevitable, there was no way around it either from a geopolitical or racial-spiritual perspective. From the positive end, he mobilized, organized and inspired the German people as a great orator and propagandist, he set a great religious imperial goal for Germany, great ideals of augmentation in race through purity and eugenics. He truly reconciled the interests of corporation and workers and rebuilt Germany. At the same time, I am not a fan of any bureaucratic state. Under Hitler Germany developed a largely conformist culture; the bookburnings and what went with them, could not be substituted by Nazi literature and indoctrination. No matter how many times you wave your hands in the air at a rally, art, whatever is beautiful, is created by free thinkers and visionaries. You cannot reconcile that with a police state at home, and the few true Nazi artists were not enough in the slightest to produce anything like that. Similarly there was no need to behave quite so brutally in war, or in the removal of the Jews. Of course, these are moral questions and completely irrelevant as long as the goal is met, but these sorts of mistakes made the Nazis unsavoury in the eyes of many, which had a political effect, and these were basically things for which there was no need. I am not a fan of Hitler's inconsistency on religion. Neither am I on class and socialism, but at least he got the right people working for him in these fields. My last piece of criticism would be the betrayal at Kristallnacht, which Hitler could've done much to prevent. It was necessary of course to liquidate the widespread power of the SA, and establish a political soldier class much loyal to Hitler and the Nazi elites, but far too many good thinkers were taken out in this affair than necessary."
"See, this is exactly the problem in the US that no one is addressing. There are dozens of groups that support white identity in one form or another, but none are willing or even discussing the possibility of uniting under one banner which is going to be NECESSARY to actually take ACTION against the ZOG system."
"Not reading anything at the moment but have started writing a prankster's handbook for kids and teenagers. Somebody needs to teach them how to raise hell and have fun like I did. One thing I'll never forget is what it was like to be a kid; I loved every second of it. Forget the shitty anarchist's cookbook and the Jolly Roger cookbooks, this'll be the Jolly Nazi's Cookbook for little skinhead hellraisers. Why shouldn't kids be pranking kikes?"

"I think Front National is a pretty cool guy, eh kills arabs and doesn't afraid of anything. While the Front National is ardently republican and a proponent of laicite, those are the two things that bother me the most about them (that and their undetermined stance on abortion and the like). Otherwise, they're pretty Bonapartist in idea - populist, referendum-loving, anti-EU and so on. Marine Le Pen is definitely not her father, and there are issues with the manner she runs the party that many people find objectionable - a possible name change, a ""softening"" of positions. There's still a long way to go before they win any major election victories, so really one should reserve judgment and see if the strategy will pay off."
"It will be our faith against their faith. Our God against nothing. And we will win. It is written that every knee shall bow. And I'd gladly be God's instrument if he would have me. The muslims shall know fear yet. Some put their trust in nations. What is nation but those most likely to stab their best and brightest in the back and then go jump off a cliff. No, I put my trust in God, for he is steadfast. Amen."
"The issue with Christian fascists is that at some point, they will see themselves confronted with a choice if push comes to shove. Will I follow the Christian teachings or will I do what my fascist ideology demands of me? Will I go forward and do something my religion tells me is immoral, because it is something my ideology tells me is necessary? Which way will I go? What is more important to me? Where lie my priorities? There might come a point where a Christian fascist chooses Christianity over fascism because the feeling of guilt that is inherent in Christianity overpowers his will to do what he must. This problem never presents itself to someone who fully subscribes to the ideology of fascism and follows a pagan European religion that has no concept of guilt. When the vikings plundered English shores, did they feel guilty for killing people and taking their goods? No, they didn't. When the Romans subdued a rebellious city and slaughtered thousands of rebels to teach them a lesson, did they feel guilty? No, they didn't. They fought an enemy and defeated him. Vae victis. Might makes right. No tears shed over the blood of those who stood against us. Would a Christian feel guilty? If the teachings of his religion are fully ingrained in him, then yes, he would. The Bible explicitly states that some acts are immoral, regardless of their reason and result. Medieval theologians worked hard to work out the requirements of what makes a war just, or of the situations where killing would be acceptable. Throughout the middle ages and early modern times you have dozens of works written by Christian clerics that call for mercy, that tell knights to be less cruel to defeated enemies even if they're of a different religion, etc etc. Why do all those mental gymnastics just to reconcile one worldview with another? Why spend that much effort when you can look to ancient paganism or Esoteric Hitlerism instead, faiths which are inherently compatible with fascist ideology and which put your own people, your own race above all else, unlike Christianity which puts the faithful over the unfaithful, which can potentially lead to a Christian respecting a Christian nigger more than his pagan white brother. It's not even the fact that Christianity has semitic origins and therefore foreign to us, it's the specific teachings of Judeo-Christianity that make it conflict with the fascist worldview. If there is one semitic people we can learn from, it's the ancient Assyrians and their attitude towards their enemies. The following is taken from an inscription of King Sennacherib of Assyria: “I cut their throats like lambs. I cut off their precious lives (as one cuts) a string. Like the many waters of a storm, I made (the contents of) their gullets and entrails run down upon the wide earth. My prancing steeds harnessed for my riding, plunged into the streams of their blood as (into) a river. The wheels of my war chariot, which brings low the wicked and the evil, were bespattered with blood and filth. With the bodies of their warriors I filled the plain, like grass. (Their) testicles I cut off, and tore out their privates like the seeds of cucumbers.” This is the kind of thing we should follow. Not ""turn your other cheek"" and ""love thy enemy"", but ""I utterly annihilated my enemies, and that is reason to be proud. Kneel before us, oh defeated, for we are victorious."" That's the attitude we need to cultivate. Cultivating this attitude amongst Christians is more difficult, for they have different teachings that first need to be reconciled with this. And if you choose fascism over Christianity, why even choose Christianity at all? Doesn't fascism already give you all the spiritual guidance and purpose you need? What does Christianity offer that fascism and compatible ancient pagan faiths do not? Salvation? We make our own salvation. We do not wait for God to save us, we prove to our gods that we are worthy of them. We do not beg for forgiveness for sins, we either atone by improving ourselves or we admit our faults and stand for what we are, and accept whatever consequences may come from it. Christians get a ""get out of jail free"" card by always being able to confess, and then God will forgive, but it is God's job to judge whether an action was right or not. The principle of fascism is one of taking repsonsibility of your actions and standing up for yourself and your people in order to achieve greatness. The principle of Christianity is to give away responsibility to God and trust in his help rather than your own. That's why doubt might be stronger in Christian fascists: they can't just go ahead and judge their own actions by themselves, they always have to wonder ""what does God think about this?""."
"Also, Iran is super based. They had holohoax cartoon festival after the Charlie Hebdo shootings and actively troll the jewish machine that controls the west and expose their hypocrsy on free spech. They are also based militarily expanding into Iraq and Yemen to undermine the US government and their puppet Saudi Arabia."
capitalism in these day=kikes. Capitalism is an emanation of the jewish type of humanity and anyone who actively engage in that process is serving the Jewish type of humanity and even being judaized himself.
"This is great period. Svitanok, stop using aryanism.net as the basis of your whole belief system. Are you a vegan? Your love for sand niggers is disgusting, how can you want a completely foreign religious system in your lands?

I really hope you're the only one of your kind."

"Same thing. Then you have never actually understood what national socialism is. It isn't racist conservatism. Someone who ""becomes"" a nazi never turns back to the worldview of lies &amp; falsehoods. What should be the penalty for faggotry and Jewry in the ideal society? Why?"
"I don't speak Swedish, so no, but Finnish and Swedish party programs shouldn't be radically different. It pretty clearly states that ""demonstrating/showing their sickness/abnormality"" is criminal. So no, there's no room for ""based homos"" like Röhm. In addition to it and the anti-faggot demo in a few weeks, during like the last week we have released a bunch of articles strongly denouncing faggotry as disease spreading, jew promoted sickness, to ""celebrate"" the Pride: http://www.vastarinta.com/kansallismielinen-liike-ja-homot/ http://www.vastarinta.com/homokulttuuri-ja-juutalaislobby/ http://www.vastarinta.com/helsinki-pride-ja-setan-tarkoitus/ http://www.vastarinta.com/onko-homokulttuuri-tervetta/ Personally, I would like faggotry as a disease to be criminalized as a symbolic act, even if it were impossible to enforce. But under the proposed law Greg Johnsons and half of Counter Currents would still be drowned in a bog so I'm pretty happy tbh."
"Kek are you guys serious with this nonsense? Worshiping Hitler as some type of god? I admire Mussolini but I don't think of him as a literal god type being, this is taking the persoanltiy cult around Hitler to a ridiculous extreme. A lot of this stuff is excellent for memes and trolling, but to seriously put stock into any of Devi's autistic shit is hilarious, considering that she herself had relations with a non white Hindu."
"I almost got AIDS by reading this thread, especially that of ""white muslims can be in our struggle"" We can admit that they have balls because all these shootings, but we don't share the same objetives.

"Points for being a conservative revolutionary of sorts, for instituting an interesting example of authoritarian traditionalist government, as I mentioned elsewhere, and finally for realising his own limitations sufficiently to create a position whereby he could lead the country and keep it from degenerating without having to run the day-to-day affairs. Points lost for putting his faith in the tradition of Islam."
"The first kike response when they cannot use ""evil white nazi six billion"". It's even better when it's paired with ""Your ignorant""."
"I am still going to clarify a coupe of things. You didn't read any of my responses, but I can't repeat myself. You can be done at any time, I just wonder why comment on it in the first place? 1. In this talk which you read, Himmler proposes practical measures of how homosexuality can be combatted. Instituting a culture that chastises embarassment or shame of women. (I think this is one of the most important) To marry off every SS man, and ensure that all men regardless are not deprived of regular female contact - even if that means use of sex workers. loosening the power of the church on social life, and maybe encouraging some healthy suspicion of it. The bottom line is these are either practical soutions or they are not, if you have a gut reaction that is so violent against any criticism or conversation, then maybe he has a point? 2. the sexual revolution you reffered to has already happened in hitler's time, under the disproving eye of reactionary moralism. This sort of thing had been going on for decades liek this and hundreds of years in actuality. Just because social conservatism happened to die off some time in the 70's doesn't change much, as it was not effective in the first place. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V04DDxUobE 3. I do not live in london, I live in a part of the country which is basically white, as is anywhere that is not a big city, so i don't know what your issue is there. Religion is basically impotent, and again I have to point to predatory islam. In big cities these 'moral' men are out raping children with impunity. In athiestic countries like Sweden and Denmark, rape was practically unheard of a few decades ago, so I would say that the inverse is true. 4. What is meant by 'blood religion' is any ritual that is based on healthy racial instincts - the idea of teaching ""paganism"" is only to the practical extent that it encourages a race consciousness and a morality of its own. 5. Your own wiki link says that the bible can still condone polygamy."
"Or maybe ""We are all European, no more Brothers wars?"" leave it to an anonymous Christcuck to not even grasp a simple concept that we do not need his Precious Jewish Cult to unify against those who would see us dead whether we are in Europe or America, or any White Country for that matter."
"- He does not support Jews, he supports Israel as an ally against Islamism. He is misguided but his ""Zionism"" is based on hatted of Islam, not on a love for Jews. He prefers Europeans/Aryans to Jews unlike the majority of Zionists that prefer Jews to Aryans. - He was a low ranking freemason. - He supported free market capitalism BUT he was a nationalist before he was a capitalist. I am paraphrasing it but in his manifesto he said ""It is not a struggle between socialism and capitalism, it is a strugle between nationalism and internationalism"". He was misguided about economics but he was not a free-maket fundementalist like many claim. - If you read his manifesto you would know he is not a virgin. -I agree that he ""copy-pasted"" far to much in his manifesto, personally I mostly skipped many of those parts as they were uninteresting. - Yes, Geert and Ayaan are scum but Breivik supports then because of their opposition to Islam. Ayaan is considered a femanist by Somalian/non-white standards by Dutch standards she would be considered center or center right. She is not as bad as a white femanist. Breivik is not an atheist, he is a non-religious Christian that sees Christianity more so in cultural then spiritual terms. He is however a non-materialist. He opposes atheistic materialism. He does not have a relationship with God but he believes in God and uses religion as a means to become stronger."
"We all know who Osama Bin Laden is, so I won't post the usual Wikipedia bio. Obviously we Americans grew up being taught that he was the Arabic Hitler, but recently I have grown interested in him. He was a radical, lover of his people, popular with the poor, and waged war on their enemies. I dislike Muslims immensely, and they have been our enemies for thousands of years, but you gotta give Osama his props, he was not willing to bow down to the American-Israeli aggression."
"It's not just the fact that he's a kike that makes him shitty, but he's so fucking smug and obnoxious. Even more so than his euphoric brother."
"Even the earliest Protestants were prone to absolutely batshit beliefs (take a look at the Munster Rebellion sometime), and this has been a constant problem with it, when you allow every idiot who can read to decide what the God's will is without any central authority or organization to guide them, you wind up with a shitty clusterfuck of conflicting faiths. Protestantism is the Christian equivalent of modern liberalism, everyone's beliefs are to be tolerated because they can interpret the bible for themselves and no one's interpretation is more valid than the next persons' and if you say different you're an evil papist who wants to holocaust 6 million free thinkers."
"The title of this thread is cringey enough. I mean, Catholicism has certain values that go hand in hand with modern conservatives. Such as having as many kids as you want because it would be unholy to actually give shit about the quality of a child's life by simply not letting the child suffer an abominable existence. We all know that Catholicism is the inferior christian denomination and that jews profit off of some of these loony cucks such as these mentioned by emoticon serb bear."
"Put the Angle back in Anglican. We could have sermons on the greatness of Christian Anglo civilisation and the glorious crusades and reconquista. In my opinion, any truly white church would need to celebrate pagan roots - i've heard many times that Catholicism blended with pagan faiths - not sure how far they did this, but its always said negatively. I'd advocate closer links with paganism. I'm not the greatest fan of most forms of protestantism, which is basically the judaisation of a religion that had become blended with European ideas, and the undoing of all the Saintly aspects that tied Christianity with white europe (i'm talking about the old saints, not modern hippie ones). Good thing that the CoE isn't fully protestant, but rather an odd mish-mash. Back in the 1090s, Catholics used to carry out mini crusades against the Jews, and in 1189 the Archbishop of Canterbury compared the Jews to demons. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_antisemitism - like a proto-shoah! The modern Jew should be seen in the same light as one of the pharisees or christ-killers. Modern neocon American protestantism is an extension of early modern protestantism - remember Cromwell the puritan? the one who allowed the Jews to return to England? Maybe we should indeed form a rebel sect of Anglicanism based on white supremacy and Anglo nationalism, drawing on older ideas and muh tradicalism... First things first, Breivik must be made the Patron Saint of the church (I know he's alive and well, but he could still count as a holy martyr)"
"Top fucking kek you have a lot to learn than. The Jews AKA Zionist Occupied Government (ZOG) control every nation on Earth besides North Korea, yes even your precious shit hole India."
"Well, number 1, you're forgetting the Eastern Orthodox church. Catholics have had a huge historical conflict with the Orthodox church ever since the schism back in I believe 1054 A.D. Catholics are the most traditional form of Christianity out of the three sects, Orthodox Christians split from the church because the archbishop of Constantinople (also the emperor of the Byzantine Empire), was butthurt about not being pope. The Protestants broke off because they were butthurt about all of the corruption and stupid strict laws in Catholicism. I'm a Catholic, so I will always support Catholicism. Naturally, Catholicism today is weak, and Liberal. They need a return to the old days, anti-kike, anti-Muslim, etc. However, the great cathedrals of the Catholic faith will always look much more grand than those of Protestant or Orthodox build (exception being the Hagia Sophia)."
"Stop being a pussy over some harsh words, if insults get to you it's obvious YOU'VE never been in the military a day in the life so why the fuck are you telling us what work and what won't?

This is so stupid that I don't even think I should answer but you seem pretty dumb so I guess I have to; 1: There's a difference between gaining experience/activism and proposing to join up with two opposing groups and fighting likes it's still 2014, you're not gaining anything of value except fighting for a ZOG puppet from a different country. You should also read intro materials on why your intro post is pure cancer and autism. 2: Why would Europeans fight for Ukraine or Azov when both shilled out for ZOG and they have no attachment to the soil there? They're better off joining their nations military and gaining experience through them. 3: Why would I join either the Ukrainian or Russian party when both are run by ZOG? This is why you're fed material, go read Next Leap, Squires Trial and SIEGE Probably because you need to pass through school so autism like this doesn't occur"
"Well, it's not that Jewry 'wins' it is just that the whole movie is focused around Jewish identity, as Jews suffer from the multicultural crap they forced on us, and now their people are being eroded; causing self-hate, fascism etc. He was a good Jew from the start, my guess is that he wanted to purge the faggoty kikes that remained in America so they would be a stronger race, but towards the end he questions his faith in both Jewry and his commitment to cure it with poison, which makes him less fascist and more concillatory. It's anyone's guess really, because the film is ambiguous, very spiritual, and leaves a lot to the audience. But realize, it is not a film about neo-nazis to begin with, it's about Jews and it's basically made for Jews. (trust me, I have special insight into the matter) you will rarely hear me say this but the film is so cryptic, and really has such a limited topic range that's completely antithetical to us that I think it's not in our place to judge. I enjoyed the Jew-beating scenes, but other things like, his speech in front of the fascist intellectuals are completely inexplicable, and based on some pie-in-the-sky Jewish identity issues. I was confused about it as well. It felt like when AHX suddenly turned into a feel-good liberal comedy hour. ""I learned racism was bad when I met a nice black guy!"" and then the whites rape him or something. It is so retarded, and then you have to sit through the amazon reviews that say 'oh it was so realistic and convincing.' Unlike that, at the very least the believer treated us seriously and without pretense. Still though, there were a few jabs, though this is mostly legitimate criticism that we should be delivering; ""Half of the people at those meetings are informants"" plus the knuckle-dragging skinhead idiot that just punches him for being from New York. That was retarded, but I guess it expressed Daniel's ubermensh-jew status. I think that, he gets tired of living a double life and sees the inconsistency in being a jewish nazi? This puts him at odds with his own rhetoric, and later his entanglement with the far right. He tries to save himself from being convicted which causes him even more estrangement and confusion. Then at the synagogue he just gives up, but that does not absolve the Jewish struggle nor relieve him of it, since he is still trapped and confused about g-d's nature of wrath mercy at the end, and resigning himself to mercy with no reason may have been the right choice (in the directory's view) but not for the right reason; which should have been careful religious study and submission to torah, whereas he did it for the emotional reason of his desire to protect the people in the synagogue. I found it confusing, and felt a bit robbed because I assumed it would be a film about nationalists and it turned out to be an ashkenazi sob fest. It is still a good philosophical movie, I think, but as usual these Jewish types leave everything to interpretation, but expect you to know the right answer (their answer) anyway. It didn't stop me from enjoying the various kike-beating scenes."
"Funny how you're completely retarded. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfvWt1xmcRk http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini#Atheism_and_anti-clericalism He would have probably personally decorated it with macaroni-kolovrats too, that he made in art school. Nothing but your reading of the bible and Christian sources shows a deep misunderstanding of what Christianity is. The elements of Christianity which you applaud, that are located in the old testament are what Christ sought to repudiate. He set the old testament as an antithetical context to his teachings and only presented it as the Judaism he sought to destroy. Things like Gnostic and Early Christianity were also Christian only in name; they were so outwardly but internally practiced pagan beliefs and even rituals with a small inclusion of Christian symbolism. This indicates that you are deliberately looking for things to justify the faith in your eyes, and forming your faith off of these questionably Christian sources rather than a deeply rooted life-long belief in what it is. I for one rejected it my whole life except a brief period where I did the same thing you did, but with the exception of that time I understood Christianity to be exactly what it is: the abandonment of struggle and submission to salvation. I say submission because it precludes yaweh's utter mastery over all life, and life itself as a deterministic experiment of his fancy, in which anyone who resists because of their nobility is crushed and broken like in the tower of Babel or any of the great civilizations which Christianity and the Jews destroyed. All great Europeans either resisted Christianity in some way or were Christian only in name; who maintained the institution because it more represented the community than the false god. That won't be a problem anymore because Christianity no longer represents the community, it represents the state and degeneration, in America as in Russia or Europe, Africa or anywhere. yeah you're really alfa, but the reason the spaghetti thing got old so fast and no one normal does it anymore is insecure little queers like you who jumped on the bandwagon to feel better about themselves. you, racis, ozy, that other fag who posted earlier etc. Also the literal gayest thing you could do is refer to your beliefs as alpha unironically on the internet. yeh sure, I'm sorry I ever interfered with your masturbation, do go on. You are my idol of masculinity, you and chuckthetruck"
"Italy is cool because they have style, whether it's fascism, crime, movies, music, whatever. A creative nations which sets the trends. The only thing they really lack is balls when it comes to fighting. Everyone here in Europe knows that, especially in the football hooligan scene. Italian ultras groups were always accused of being pussies by practically everyone, the only exception is Napoli which is a really tough away game for everyone but that's because they use knives all the time and stab everyone who they can, regardless if hooligan or normal fan. Italians especially fear the Balkans, I remember back in 2003 there were like 4000 or 5000 Hajduk Split fans in Rome and on the return game in Split a week later only few dozen Roma ultras came because they didn't have the balls. So even in ultras scene Italians set the trend in the 80s but now all the tough groups are in Eastern Europe (especially Balkans, Poland, Hungary and Russia). You could argue the same in fascism, they basically invented the ideology but Nazi Germany ended up being much more powerfull in terms of sheer physical force. Most people here have quite low opinion of Italians but I always liked them precisely because they have such cool political stuff related to fascism. Neo-NS scene in Germanic in Slavic countries was always a bit bonehead compared to Italian neo-fascism. For example if you take a look at Italian neo-fascist music they mostly have quite interesting lyrics, while 80% of Slavic RAC is about killing Muslims/niggers or something about Rudolf Hess."
"&gt;being this defensive against stereotypes &gt;2014 What are you, a fucking jew? Don't have any overwhelmingly negative perceptions of America as a whole and sure as fuck don't love it either. don't even give it a thought."
"Islam destroys ethnic identity, Christianity doesn't."
"Oh I do agree completely. The white race has itself to blame for a large part of what has happened to them. To say that the plight of our race can only be blamed on others would imply we are no different to niggers. We trusted the Jew. We let the negro into our communities. We even allowed the Arab into Europe. I have faith, however, that we can solve our current situation. It might be long and difficult, but I am optimistic that we will prevail."
inb4 they are all kikes
"HE FOUND IT, SHUT HIM DOWN! Huh, I guess the Bulgarians were the first one to use ""7-year-old girl war meme"". In past they were defying kings, now they are defying brutal arab dictatorships :^ )"
I'm talking about future black pathers on European soil or in neighborhood. How long before some kike decides it would be fun to nuke evil white people.
"I am 19 years old and currently working odd jobs to earn some money so I can go learn a trade, most likely some sort of machining, construction or possibly a butcher. I come from a German and Italian family so naturally since I was a child I always had an interest in the axis power's of World War 2, but I never really considered myself a national socialist until recently. The area I live in has recently become riddled with thugs and a disgusting drug problem. I was never a whole hearted racist but I am now, my community was once decent, not perfect but not a ghetto either. Once the blacks began moving into the area I witnessed with my own eyes the increase of violence, break ins, and drug use near my home. Here, you can walk down the streets and find a heroin needle and bottles scattered around the road, its pathetic. But what really pushed me towards a nationalist way of thinking was when I saw so many whites that I had grown up with trying to be ""thugs"" and constantly trying to impress the recent negro's that have infested the area. It's no surprise that the majority of them are now heroin addicts. I hate how the negro's way of life is glorified in the media by the jew's, which in turn makes young whites impressionable and traitors to their race. I believe it's time for the white man to stand up and take back power from the corporate kike's and their minority armies. The amount of scum that live around me makes me angry, but even more on edge. I constantly worry about the people I care about getting harmed by the reprobates. Race relations in my area are terrible, a group of four niggers recently gunned down an innocent bystander outside of a catholic school and naturally are getting life sentences, and since black's have been extremely hostile to whites. There was once even an occasion where I was at a shopping center and got a gun pulled on me by a group of blacks, all because I laughed at a nigger crackhead who was talking to himself. On a more positive note, since I became a natural socialist I've noticed that its made me strive to be a superior man. I've changed my diet, stopped drinking and more. I truly believe if more white's adopted a nationalist way of thinking they too would strive to be as great as their European forefathers instead of buying into the Jewish mainstream ideal's that want to keep everyone idiotic. I've recently become religious again (I am a catholic) and I am trying my hardest to lead other white's I know down the path to greatness. My skill's include gun experience, boxing (if that counts) as well as a lot of wood working experience. My interest's include reading and writing, learning about history and politics, building furniture and working with animals. I am eager to talk with likeminded people here and also learn more."
"http://www.churchofthesonsofyhvh.org/mywebb/1/your_heritage.htm I thought this was quite a good sermon by Bertrand Comparet. It looks at Biblical prophecy in relation to CI: ---- ""Sennacherib's own record of this says, ""I then besieged Hezekiah of Judah, who had not submitted to my yoke, and I captured 46 of his strong cities and fortresses and innumerable small cities which were round about them, with the battering of rams and the assault of engines and the attack of foot soldiers, and by mines and breaches made in the walls. I brought out there from 200,150 people"" Keep in mind he would exaggerate, but add to that 200,000 of the Tribes of Benjamin and Judah in 701BC. And that 20,000 deported by Sargon II was just from the city of Samaria alone. What the fuck are you on about, modern Talmudic kikery could not be more different from the ancient Israel of King David..."
"There should be a crusade started in England by pushing all the sand and cave niggers back to Mecca and along the way colonizing Israel and making it a Christian nation with strict immigration policies where only Christians can visit (or live if they contribute towards the nation) and worship. Where the kikes go is of no importance to me, it could be the oven or Madagascar for all I care. Make it like Mecca is for the muslims."
"I don't know about all of you, I did the same thing. Niggers and jews, bad news. A world without kikes and coons is like one without rats and roaches. sieg heil 14/88 boots on the ground, no one has changed their opinion; black nationalist comes on once a month to talk about his niggerdom and so what? He can use the forum as he pleases and so can we, which is why he comes on so rarely and people pay scant regard. For everyone that is worried we are turning into zog, remember this is the same thing that happened with Der Lowe, where we had a similar shitfest; granted, Der Lowe is actually intelligent, so he holds his ground. But whatever, HE is forced to adapt, and performs all sorts of mental gymastics to justify being a German Jewish Nazi, and we still laugh at it. Ahad-Ha-am plainly left. Forum is to big for spergerie and trolls, we have moved past that. I for one welcome a real militant Jewish nationalist; except this is not what we see here, we have never had it. This is a typical new york capitalkike, with no plans to emigrate, and he will be treated as such. Here is a picture of what it looks like irl; http://flix.tapuz.co.il/v/watch-2319667-.html"
"OH HE'S CATHOLIC!!! Jesus was a massive anti Semite, brat. Our Church has beautiful history of pogroms, learn to embrace it. Jews killed Jesus. They are the Freemasons and heretics infiltrating the Church. Synagogue of Satan."
burn them Jews
"They both are shit. Jews enforce many harmful policies and look out for their own, while muslims are essentially sand-colored niggers, don't fit in Western civilization, and act like braindead chimps on default. You can't pin it all on kikes, sandniggers just can't get along, jews or no. And when there are no other sandniggers to fight, they begin sectarian fighting. For example, a good chunk of our immigrants are Kurds that are fighting with other kebabs. And sadly, here it's the white do-gooders responsible here for opening the borders, not jews, although their external influence cannot be underestimated. Why choose? Hate them both."
"Didn't Don Black add a feminazi as a moderator? I remember reading that there was a female moderator who openly expressed a sexual desire for Arabs and that was apparently okay.

So... remove kebab?
"The ""wandering scholars"" and ""religious reformers"", and he later goes on about ""knights of the pen"", combatants using ""the weapon of the mind"" and ""Messianic Precursors of the Twentieth Century"", obviously refer to Occult-minded ""esoterics"" of the likes of Serrano, the ultimate riddle babbler. -- @topic Why the need to confound everything, making everything more complex and obscure than they really are? The Jew is a simple parasite among mankind just like there are parasites among other species, that's all there is to it, and this alone warrants us gassing them. Spouting fantastic sci-fi stories and hype drug trips involving a Demiurge and Golems, Nazi flying saucers/vimanas and seven heavens only confounds and obscures thinking and action.

"They are fighting for self-determination and their right to a government free from foreign/international and kike influence. If we want the same for ourselves why shouldn't we support them? Quite the contrary, if you expect to form a coalition then the only way to prove your commitment is by fighting for others' freedom as well, and being the first to do so. This is the law of leaderships and only afterwards will others follow suit. It seems like it is open for a backstab (will they really fight for us after?) but this is the sort of logic our enemies are using to DnC. And besides that it's a war. the yoofs are restless, time to spill some blood already"
"really for specific instances the term 'white' is redundant. Turkey is a Hellenic population that was vertically assimilated by the Seljuk Turks, but who's traits resurfaces in the Ottoman Empire and were mixed with other coexisting but distinct populations (like Armenians.) With time they kept receding toward the mean, and now there are no classes or regions anywhere where the groups are very distinct or any Turkish type that hasn't a moderate amount of Turk and other blood. Turkey has always been secular Muslim and unaligned with any niggerized Islam. I do have a little bit of respect for them but by no means can they be considered a part of the European family alongside Nordics. They are effectively a nation destroyed by race mixing, along with ancient Sumer or India, but which also still yield rare recombination of their Aryan blood memory, which peers through millennia of degeneration."
"Dmowski was pretty anti-German because of the partitions. I think I read once that he had sympathies to Hitler though. Wouldn't really surprise me if he did. Many politicians were being influenced by Hitler, Franco, and Mussolini at the time (There was a Pro-Hitler politician and publicist who tried during the war to integrate the Polish Army into the Wehrmacht but the NSDAP refused - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_Studnicki). In the interwar period, Anti-Semitism was rampant in Poland. Jews were actually legally segregated at Universities in ghetto benches. I know what picture you're talking about btw, the infograph with ""Hitler and PiÅ‚sudski"". It used this picture in it: Also, another pre-war photo with Goebbels and PiÅ‚sudski: I'm glad you're a Condreanu fan because I am too. I think Iron Guard is a legendary movement. Unfortunately Soviet kikes stole our border with Romania so Poland was never able to really interact or build a strong relationship. I consider myself to be a Clerical Fascist and I am impressed on how he made his movement devoutly Orthodox. Faith in god is great. Real men need God. And to clarify what I said with ""uninterested and unimpressed"", I was not referring to Jobbik, but ONR. I support Jobbik immensely. As far as I know, the reason Falanga was created because a member named Bartosz Bekier was kicked out or something for being ""too radical"", so he just made his own group. There are actual Falanga members on IM so you could ask them the specifics. My group is very private so I'll be willing to address it if you private message me. As for off-Topic Polish history, we can still use this thread, since heroes are synonymous to history. Ask away Magyar!"
"You know what? If there was a choice between the Jew or the Gypsy to disappear and no option of making one carry the other under their arms, I'd still pick to save the Gypsy over the Jew for the simple fact that you could pay Gypsies to kill themselves, that's how fucking dumb they are. The true remedy for this plague is mass sterilization. Someone give me a good, non-'humanitarian' reason for it. Wtf is a zionist Gypsy anyway? How the fuck do you reconcile Gypsies with any political movement, let alone zionism? I'll take a good guess and say it's to do with war time stories and reparation deals...am I close?"
"Hey Goyles, upload more prank calls. Funniest shit ever! ""How about I bring the full might of jewish lawyers against that Nazi nigger"" ""He called me a STUPID. FUCKING. JEW."""
"I don't blame the Muslims. This movement is middle class, spineless, holier-than-thou whites who think they know so well the difference between ""moderate Islam"" (people who wear the attire but where conflicts arise between Islamic doctrine and neoliberalism side with liberalism) and ""radical Islam"" (people who follow aspects of Islam they don't like). It's not even for the benefits of Muslims who might get hurt feelings on public transit it's just so that these leftists can feel good about themselves. It just illustrates how far things have progressed to where people's first response has become #notALLmuslims instead of anger at being taken advantage of in your own country."
"The 'Muslims' of today disgust me, yet I will always hold respect for the few remaining true descendants of men such as Osman I and Mehmed II. Fierce, yet honorable enemies upon the battlefield and inovative men at home. ""Son! Be careful about the religious issues before all other duties. The religious precepts build a strong state. Do not give religious duties to careless, faithless and sinful men or to dissipated, indifferent or inexperienced people. And also do not leave the state administrations to such people. Because the one without fear of Allah, has no fear of the created. One who commits a great sin and continues to sin can not be loyal. Scholars, virtuous men, artists and literary men are the power of the state structure. Treat them with kindness and honour. Build close relationship when you hear about a virtuous man and give wealth and grant him...Put order the political and religious duties. Take lesson from me so I came to these places as a weak leader and I reached to the help of God although I did not deserve. You follow my way and protect Islam and the believers and also your followers. Respect the right of God and his servants. Do not hesitate to advise your successors in this way. Depend on God's help in the esteem of justice and fairness, to remove the cruelty, attempts in every duty. Protect your public from enemy's invasion and from the cruelty. Do not behave any person in an unsuitable way with unfairness. Gratify the public and save all of their sake."" - Osman I"

"And that makes it okay? Oh well, I should expect that coming from a portunigger. Then get the fuck back home and join a movement. Fight for your own people, don't just flee from them and do the same things that the Pakis are doing in England: stealing jobs. You need to get back there and join the struggle to mend your country. You would turn your back on your millennia-spanning bloodline and mix with Anglos. What a fucking traitorous thought. When Hitler saw economic depression, him and his people starving, and Germany's fate ultimately being famine, did he flee to some other country and breed with foreigners? Absolutely not. He joined the DAP and later formed the NSDAP, gained the love of the people and took office. He ended an economic depression for the first and fastest time in history. He amazingly prevented a German famine. I know, you're not Hitler. But you could sure as hell learn a thing or two from the action he took. And I know for a FACT that the situation in your country is a hell of a lot better than Germany's situation in the 1920's. Grow up and RESIST!"
"The abscesses on the body of Canada must be cut until delicious maple syrup flows out. And they must be allowed to flow for a good, long time. You know, because that way it flows down here and I don't pay the jews (or amish) seven bucks for a 6oz bottle of maple syrup."
I remember being a teenager and having sympathy for Islam because of the fact that it was constantly being pushed around by Israel and USA. That has changed.
"Why do you have a knife-cut/scar on your neck-jaw region? I really warn you that you do not look into any forms of Hinduism or any of the eastern religions. I was wrong about them. They are a fake light that will ultimately lead you to spiritual death and deception. But if you insist, a great start would be to google into the works and life of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, and his disciple the Swami Vivekananda. And of course, the knowledge thereof is not complete without studying of the Gita. But be very very very careful with what you take in from many of these gurus, they are tightly affiliated with wayward teachings, communities and people."
"Haha, sadly I found this forum through this post. No, it is not, or, at least not in the sense you are thinking of. Satanism like that spouted by kikes like Euronymous is just an inversion of Roman Catholic theology, and therefore cannot exist as anything other than a counterculture within a larger Christian culture. However, pan-European Satanism, or worshiping a monolatrist P.I.E. deity (almost always Odin or Cernunnos) as Satan, can play a part in resurrecting our pagan roots as the vanguard front that cleanses Judaeo-Christianity from our homeland. After that, it has no use of existence. Oh, there's also Luciferianism, which can be described in some contexts as monolatrist worship of the Greek deity Prometheus, which CAN theoretically exist after the purge, but it is rooted in anti-Christian theology."
"The categories: ""us"" and ""other,"" with subcategories of ""other"" being allies, neutral, and enemies. I don't think anybody here is saying Bobby Fischer is one of ""us"" or that Jews should be ""us."" Most Jews are firmly in the enemy category, but there is a very short list of ones who fit into neutral and an even shorter list of ones that can possibly fit into allies."
"Is that a culture of ""useless mud-mass of stupidity and incompetence"" or not? It looks like you are on the right track with the runes. Look at the average Somalian with a mean IQ of 68. NikolajeviÄ‡ didn't argue for equality. To be white is not a value in itself, just like to belong to any 'nation' (in the modern sense) is not a virtue (the traditional meaning of nation is a different story). Take a look at this metaphor: if you are trapped in a desert and an angel offers you to choose between two cups of water, which one would you pick? The bigger cup with only a sip of water in it, or the smaller cup which is almost full? If you have a potential and you neglect it in order to live a more simple life you commit a greater sin than those of without that potential. On the other hand, Jews are usually high scoring on these IQ tests, and that means there is another angle to our metaphor, namely the quality of the water. Is that clean or poisoned? You have to take into consideration the trinity of spirit, soul and body in a whole, and know the hierarchy between them."
"A nigger church is not a fucking 'holy place', I don't see why we should give a shit about that. The church he shot up was a place visited by MLK and some of Obama's personal friends. Dylann attacked an unholy temple of the Judeo-Christian slave religion, a sanctuary for beasts and race traitors. God is on the side of truth, and the ultimate truth is racism. If you aren't going to do anything for your race then you have NO excuse to complain about Aryan warriors of Dylann's caliber. About him killing 'random blacks', he killed a fucking State Senator, that's what I call striking at the heart of the enemy."
"Dylann is a hero, he did what he thought was right to continue acclerationism and to kill a bunch of BLM fuckers and Jews. People whining about morality here about nigger babies and elderly is laughable, only defeat is immoral, Zero Tolerance."
