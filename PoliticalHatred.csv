"Ok, well I guess you will need some background on this one. My mother works in a school, a really ghetto school full of Indians (The local kind) and mostly white trash. So, she works in the Library and they were putting on a book fair, you know promoting literacy and what not. But last night someone broke in and took all the book fair money, the money from the Pizza Day fundraiser, the field trip fund, the school's float and several mac computers and iPads. So with the cops coming in and fingerprinting everything the teachers start telling the kids what happened. One kid however, a little girl, wont even make eye contact. So they take her into the hall and talk to her, she says she didn't do it but when asked if some of her family did it she broke down and started to cry. So they are pretty damn sure her family did it. But get this, the kid is in part time foster care because her mother is a drugged out drunk Indian who has been charged with child endangerment several times. We dont even need to import degenerates here, we have our own homegrown degeneracy. Such is life in the Liberal Utopia Zone."
"I don't understand how anybody coming from a Nietzschean* perspective would decide libertardism is the way to go. The first thing learning about will to power and natural hierarchy taught me is what a foolish and unrealistic concept an individualist society where everybody leaves each other alone is.

"Our goal is the destruction of the system, the alt-right want to work within it. We cannot compromise with a group that conflicts with such an objective. The very nature of the goal requires absolute conviction and no compromise what so ever if it does not contribute to the cause. I'd sooner support Black Lives Matter than the alt-right, the nigs at least are being productive in their fight against the pigs. The alt-right want only reaction, a return to a dead 1950's racist America that will never return. We are extreme because it is necessary, there is no intermediary in what we want for we want the total death of the modern world. The alt-right are in fact a fifth column, giving a false sense of security and fostering the Trump cult. They are siphoning off potential soldiers of the cause who are just a single step away from total revolutionary radicalization. There is only one way in dealing with the alt-right and that is taking as many salvageable members as we can and letting the rest rot."
"Its a common way for leftards to attack nationalism using things like this. I'm not sure whether this is authentic or not, but leftards usually use this to show the ""folly"" of nationalism by discrediting and debasing the nation that the ideology is aimed at. This is mostly done by attacking the geneology of prominent ideologues, or the identities of prominent faces and people that come to mind. For example, a leftist wishing to attack, say National Socialism, does this by claiming that Adolf Hitler's grandmother was a Jew, and miraculously produces some old person that confirms this. It does not matter whether it is the truth or not, its just a form of psychological warfare, brothers."
"I have no problems with my views around the people I'm around. To stay on topic: Whenever I read about Hungarian news or accidentally land on a liberal page I quickly close the tab. Online media in Hungary is most of the time horribly liberal. These EU maniac, immigrant loving retards make me lose my temper fast. Gladly I don't read the news anymore."
Have you seen these counter protests. I hope they tear down every god damn statue in this country. Maybe then these people will understand what is going on. If the alt rightt gets all their stuff shut down and doxxed this could be the best thing that has happened to the movement in america ever. #teardownJefferson http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/14/us/confederate-statue-pulled-down-north-carolina-trnd/index.html
"Sure some of them are of course, but we are talking about queers who use specialized pronouns or at least support using them. Or maybe you don't understand how fucking gay young american leftists are, I've seen enough from the internet as well as real life to know you can't put any sexual perversion past them. This stuff right here definitely has some trolls in it, but when you consider what goes on in the minds of these ""people"" it starts to border on Poe's law. Because let's be honest if you told the average person that some freaks want to fuck ponies and dogs with six packs they might not believe you, and that filth is worse than a couple of gays role playing as vampires."
"In my opinion, all government parties have been ""infected"" and really don't represent the people. Right or left, it's always going to be the same result, the day of politics is over. Too many jews and shills involved. The only way for a true party to surface that represents the people and stands for something good would have to result from the destruction of the corrupt government. I think that only through a anarchistic revolution people will welcome fascism and true nationalist ideas. Though I don't know much about French politics, I remember seeing Macron saying something like ""We're just going to have to get used to terrorist attacks."" Who knows, if he wins over Le Pen he might run the country so far down the toilet people give up on the government and fight back. But hey, I don't pay attention to French politics so I'm really not sure what either of the two candidates are like."
"A lot of those kids weren't just simple leftist losers, some of them had their parents as higher-ups in Norwegian government and (((elite))) (which was center-left and pro-immigration at that time), so obviously Breivik wasn't targeting them as simply kids, but as family members of people of ruling politicians."
"The Alt-Right has been shilling, yes, shilling for trump over the last year. You are a shill if you support the man because not only do you directly support a system which has evidently been cheated and manipulated time and time again to produce corrupt results to benefit materialism, government dependency, and sub-human parasites, but you are also supporting a man who is blatantly incompetent, showing that you are easily manipulated by a man who can say things that piss people off. He is still a materialistic capitalist, he is not nearly as dirty as the other people running, but he is still dirty. The single benefit of Trump is that it has given rise to White Traditionalism and Youth Nationalism, as well as a rise of hard right-wingers unafraid to speak their minds. That is the only benefit, and it is a detriment as well because they are fiercely loyal to a man who has expressed how explicitly capitalist and anti-fascist he is. ~ Speaking of brew, my mead turned out wonderfully this year. I used some wild blackberries growing in the woods out back and along with the herbs I used, got a bitter grapefruit-like flavor."
"I attend a High School in California. Everyday I wake up at about 6:30 to get ready for school. I eat a regular breakfest consisting of Milk and eggs every morning. I Arrive at school at about 7:20, approx 23 minutes before the bell rings calling for all students to attend their classes. I managed to maintan a 4.0 GPA last semester, I attend the Football/soccer/baseball games at a regular basis. I don't get in trouble. I get along well with the other students. I have plenty of friends. Sounds great doesn't it? Not really. I found a couple of things that I believe is wrong with my school, and perhaps the entire high school district (If it is identical to my own in these matters). So I wish to broach a couple of main ideas that I believe are degenerate. 1) When I arrive to school at about 7:20, a ""Special"" buss pulls over the parking lot. Carrying, of course, a bunch of mentally unstable, crippled and physically deformed Individuals. Now, being said, it's more common that these Individuals be put in ""special"" classes segregated from the normal Human beings. No this is not the case. These degenerates share classes with those of Normal mental and physical status. For one of my periods these is this Degenerate that has some sort of paranoid mental illness that causes him to rock back and forth in his chair, talk to himself, droll on the desk and yell aloud pointless notions. What does the teacher do? Nothing. I got in trouble for simply speaking out my mind to one my class mates on what I thought of them, the teacher unfortunatly heard. So I expressed my views to her, on how they should be sterilized. I went even far, as to support Euthanasia. I was branded as a ""Nazi"" for saying so. Yet do they truley contribute to society in anyway? They do not think, they do not work, they only breath and consume and at times get in the way of those whom are actully mentally capable of tackling on life! Not to mention, but this Mentaly blind degenerate wacked me his stick on my face and outraged I pushed him on the ground, not knowing he was blind, the security sent me to office. I was again, in trouble and it was actully subjected as an ""Act of hate"". These people are often discriminated openly. One can only imagine what they feel (thats if they can) or even think of what's happening. Am I right or am I wrong? 2) Gangs &amp; drugs. My School is actully infested with Gangs and Tagger groups that only promote subversive content. Disgusting Bald headed mongrels, infested with tattoo's all over their bodies, wearing XXXXXXXXL pro-club wife beater shirts with size 60+ Dickies shorts. They don't attend the School for the Educational opportunity, they only attend to mooch off the system. It's a fact, that more then half don't even graduate. Meanwhile these savages roam around in groups of 6-10, the school does nothing to get rid of them. If I could count the number of how many gang related fights I have witnessed first hand, I would have about 17 bucks. I mean, I was actully sent to office to have a private meeting with the principle in my 9th grade year for writing an essay promoting Eugenics. The Liberal principle did his best to condemn for Hate Speech, but he could not, because my essay had nothing to do with Hate, racism or any of that hocus-pocus Bulls*it and instead I clearly pointed out to him the problem regarding gangs and how they were the REAL threat to the school. I shut him up, when I told him, that if he had the balls to give everyone a drug test in the school, about half would be convicted of being drug users. My voice has no meaning to them. The gangs will continue to pollute the school with their garbage. 3) Political correctness. History class has always been my favorite. Yet the leftist propaganda is just..... We spend more time chatting about Black-rights and womens rights or minority rights, and all this load of crap then actully history itself. Meanwhile learning about the civil war, the only thing we covered was slavery, when learning about the progressive era we learned about Immigrants, when learning about the roaring 20's we learned about the Black Jazz age and womens rights, meanwhile learning about the great depression we learned about how immigrants, blacks and other minorities suffered more then the anglo-Americans, meanwhile learning about world war II we learned more about the Holocaust, the blacks in the U.S military and airforce (tuskegee airmen, also depicted in the film red tails) the persecution of the Jap's in Interment camps and of course we actully have to feel sorry about the bombings of Hiroshima and nagasaki! I of course, love to bash my minority-loving Liberal teacher. I, along with some other patriotic comrades, team up to shove into the face of the Liberal nit-witt what we think about what she teaches. We glorify the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki, we explain how it was vital to national security to put those japs in camps, we explain how the holocausti s highly exagerated and how is has nothing to do with American history and we don't realy give a fuck about the tuskegee airmen. I was kicked out of class, by simplying telling my teacher head on, that the reason they feed us all this liberal garbage of black/minority suffering is to have us feel sorry for them. Of course she replies, explaining how it's only told to prevent it from happening again in the future, and I say that's a loud of crap. By repeating the same stuff of how these peopel were enslaved, discriminated and so and so you only further seperate them from everyone else. It's like you're giving them special treatment. What has happened to American History class? There's no longer any glorificaiton of American history, tradition and triumphs... 4) Patriotism. It seems the one can no longer be as patrotic. My school is majority Hispanic ( I have nothing against hispanics, I can name several Patriotic Americans that are of Hispanic decent such as myself ). Anyways, the majority of the students at my campus as hispanics. Even though the majority were born in the U.S, they still wave their shitty mexican flags and speaking the spanish launguage. This is always ignored by the teachers and security. Meanwhile a student can wave with pride a mexican flag and yell out ""mexican pride!"" (ironic considering they were not born in the country) the teachers will do nothing but smile. But of course, an American patriot rockng a shirt with an American flag on it is always noticed and discriminated. Such things often get into my head. I was outraged during my english class, this Mexican-immigrant that speaks fairly good english, would contnue to chat in his native launguage DURING english class. Meanwhile the teacher (a Democrat) would do nothing, I took his precious mexican flag and ripped it. Cost me lunch detention. Also... We all know the Cinco de mayo do we not? The Holiday in which the Mexicans defeated the French army and their mexican aristocrats on the 5th of may 1862 is largley celebrated in my school. The School provides music and games, all glorifying this great day! Hell they celebrate this day more then they would the 4th of July... Well me and band of buddies copied what some other students did a couple years back, and we came to school that day wearing shirts, shoes and backpacks carrying american flags, depicting patriotic displays and nationalist quotes. The face on those traitorous Mexico loving cowards starred at us in awe. The school authorities told us to turn out shirts over (just like they did with the students at the other shcool) we refused. The good news is that we wern't in trouble Well, that's about it. Just wanted to point out the things in my school which i believe are degenerate. I wonder if any of you agree..."
Being from a noble lineage with a good sense of tradition combined with the appeal of Traditional Catholicism. Add to that an admiration of Imperial Japan/Germany and a disgust of liberal degeneracy. I just then realised that fascism is the only truth below Heaven.
"Some nerd ass 4chan prole with nothing better to do would go to whatever new site has replaced milw0rm and hack into those motherfuckers. The mentality you technocrats have is deluded idealism at best and autistic at worst. It's almost as bad as these liberals who know shit about Science but go on about stem cells as if they were pulled out of Christopher Reeve's ass. Nobody is interested in this robots shit anymore, but good luck with that. Besides, I want to keep nigger slaves and the black man down, I don't need no faggot robots that some chink or sperg is gonna hack."
"I'm pretty sure stretch marks are one of those things almost everybody has that is just exploited ,like every other minor flaw, to sell skin laser treatments that cost as much as a car. And since feminism is as capitalist and exploitative as the rest of the system, it peddles shits like these to get low self esteem kids to join their ranks. The list isn't that bad tbh especially for feminism I thought it would be an article celebrating fatness but not so much, If you didn't gain any weight from child to adult you would die. Even men have stretch marks, even Victoria's secret girls. Sometimes men grow tall so fast they get the horizontal kind along the back"
"Have they tried anything since 1941? Russia isn't going to try to invade a NATO-tied - as much as I don't like NATO, Russsia does recognize its authority - country. Finland is also a part of the EU, which goes without saying. Now, once the EU collapses and NATO loses power, then you guys can worry but we have at least another 15 years before that happens, so focus on the real physical enemy that is going to be pouring in from Sweden (SJW, Muslims, Africans etc). This is just my opinion."
"I believe in a United Europe of independent nations, not the current edifice. All cultural and fiscal monetary policy should remain within the contol of the separate nations. Europe should have a general cooperative ecconomic and foriegn policy along with a European army contributed to from the armies of each nation. This would enable Europe to secure natural resorces in the world against the other power blocks. The current structure set up in the interests of stateless investors and ruled by cultural marxists and liberals destroys the nations and peoples of Europe. Thanks and yes. I Joined not long after the party emerged from the BFS."
I'm seriously using something akin to this the next time some libfag wants to argue about it with me.
This is why you're a dirty communist yid
":') You get my point. Interestingly, you see lots of laughing at yourself and general humour here. Yet on RevLeft, it's all spergout srsnss 1000% God, they're just so....degenerate. I don't even want to waste my time looking through that site. Think I might make an old school Communist account and troll them about how the original communists would have gassed them for their degeneracy and point out how Liberalism and anti-racism had fuck all to do with Communism back in the good ol' days. Might throw loads of DPRK stuff too. Fuck it, Ill also praise Jim Jones. Make them all realise they are just like that Communist Gothic kid from Liberal Degeneration thread. God that kid is glorious. Such a Commie, with his capitalist clothing and mobile phone..."
"""Your thoughts on Hitler, caesar, Jews, fags, race?"" Hitler was powerful leader, I can understand that, but not as good as Caesar. Caesar was an outstanding leader, better than Hitler in my opinion, he didn't have other generals do his work, he did it himself. About Jews, no comment. Fags, they are as bad as liberals and should die. I believe that as a race, whites are superior, we've created vast Empire's, technology, and so many other things as a race, and it should be respected by all other races."
"What? Using the state to direct/regulate the market seems like a left-wing pinko thing to do, if you ask me. Still, I think a lot of us here agree with you on this. I have no problem with capitalism so long as the state is on hand to make sure economic growth serves the interests of the nation rather than a select elite. If we're mostly in agreement why are you always so confrontational? It hurts my feelings. You seem to be rejecting one of the keystone morals of Fascism and that is Social Justice. It would be mighty fine if we could all rip each other to shreds in pursuit of personal gain but it would destroy the Country -bottom line. Every Country is in a kum-ba-ya love-fest to improve living conditions for poor people who have holes in their shoes and no belt. If you decide to adopt an economic model that accelerates growth and efficiency while leaving behind those doing much of the hard work then your putting our mighty blue-collar proletarian supermen in jepordy and bringing the Country one step closer to ruin."
"I was raised with a zoroshtrian background, and I too have to admit there is a lot of bullshit that we say. I'm a deist at heart and I've even had year long ""episodes"" of atheism, but the truth is, it's the BASIC human instinct to have faith and deep down acknowledgement with a higher power. To be like these shitwad fedorautistic Atheist these days, you would have to be incredibly dishonest with what you know deep down inside. The book essentially implies that *understanding* faith in the higher power is a must for *knowing* Fascism intimately. The worldview of Fascism requires faith, obedience and devout will just like in religions. I be utterly amazed by the lack of respect towards your Christianity in Europe. It's almost like the entire population shitted it's very own roots which keeps the Cosmic order in Europe with strength. If the teachings of that religion (especially the old testament) be unleashed and taught in the right way, it could wipe the leftist and ""democratic"" cancer that clings onto the minds of the west. Use the several Solarian aspects of Christianity against the Catholic masses of the west, and discourage all that edgy-wedgy liberal atheishitism by propagandizing Solarian Churchism to the faith-sheeps, and we could gain much ground for the day of the rope to begin. Religion, especially your guys's Christianity, is a powerful force for our cause, use it rightly for our goal instead of considering the use of tribal ooga booga that nobody considers to give a shit about anymore. There is no Messiah/Fuhrer or Priest/Ruling-Castes in odinist or Atheist nonsense, use the christian diamonds while they are in your grasp. It almost seems like time is dying out for that."
"Typical leftist autistically screaming ""THEY ARENT INFERIOR THEY HAVE RIGHTS TOO DONT OFFEND"" just makes it even more obvious, that they are inferior groups, whoever they may be, muslims, niggers, etc. This being offended on someone else's behalf is like that one thing you just don't mention in a social setting. Leftists are autistic and have no gut feeling for social settings. They're just as spergy in a political context."
"I don't lament the death of the American system or government, I lament the death of the Anglo-Saxon America and the white American culture. Those and the government have been separate beings since the Jews took hold. The true America will come soon brother, the eagle must burn to return as a phoenix. Our old symbol of the Fasces will be relevant again soon. We'll be lucky if that's whats next, the Mormons would be happy at least I think they're going to try and push either zoophilia or pedophilia next, they'll test the waters a bit for sure but honestly liberal Americans are so fucking stupid you can feed them any bullshit as long as you word it right. Change pedophilia to ""cross-generation love"" and boom"
"Wrong answer, stop being a Cuckservative it hasn't gotten anybody anywhere in the world. Forget your little individual feelings because they won't do you any good and hold you back in the long run. Jews don't have feelings for anybody, but themselves which is clear as they're destroying our European culture, our heritage, our traditions, our way of life etc. Telling them to leave in a week, well that's as realistic as Hitler killing 6 million yiddle diddles. Deporting Jews doesn't work it's been tried for hundreds of years throughout many different nations. They're parasites and the only way to get rid of a parasite is to destroy it. Burn it, gas it, shoot it, drown it whichever you prefer."
"Cooperation of this extent is what lead to liberals saying that Muslims are ok and that they should be invited to rape, rob, and kill Europeans. I am not sympathetic in this instance, I apologize. They want someone to clean their dishes? I have a better idea, maybe they are anti-Zionist liberals (as many liberals are) who think the evil Jew is oppressing the hostile natives in the Middle East. So why not feel sorry for them and let them into your country. And then be surprised when crime goes through the roof. I am glad you are not in government in Europe. I do not know if you are a bad person, I will assume you are probably a nice guy. But crime is evil and wrong. You may be sympathetic to cooperation with people who beat European women, but I am not. Difference of opinion I suppose. Reading nonsense like that makes me want to get on my hands and knees and pray to Jesus Christ."
"Well those faggots and communists did deserve it tbqh and I don't think muslims should do it, We should be doing it as Dr. Pierce stated when 9/11 happened. It's laughable you're getting assmad for me saying muslims killing communists and fags is a good thing though."
"Fuck the Liberal Degeneration, I want my memes thread clean and pure!"
This. This is why I can't really call myself a fascist I suppose. I will not swear dying allegiance to the government under any and all circumstances. The current U.S. government is Marxist and pro faggot/tranny/feminist/degenerate to the core. But many of you seem to think we should throw ourselves on a grenade to defend even the most disgusting governing body to ever exist? Remove the drugs and faggotry and many of you are no different than the antifa government fetishists you so hate. Too masochist/cuckold for me.
"C'mon man. You know what I'm talking about. We don't have to accept leftist faggotry conclusions from scientific discoveries. Yes, we're evolved from primates but that doesn't make all humans equal. It is actually evolution that makes us unequal. Sure homosexual sex happens in the wild. .as an act of violence. So does cannibalism but that shouldn't be normalized or accepted and neither should faggotry. The fact is that with the proliferation of scientific information and education it is going to get increasingly more difficult to convince those in first world countries that there is any truth and validity to supernatural religious claims. The cat is out of the bag so what do we do now? Honest question."
You all should have seen that coming at the idiotic choice of name That video should be in liberal degeneration
"Not really; I think your Catholic bias is showing a bit. I don't particularly like Fred Phelps and co. methods of protest, his work history (civil rights lawyer... in his words, for easy money.. I'm not particularly fond of lawyers anyway though), or his entire theology, but on most principles he is correct. I particularly like their written articles on God's hatred and the design of their websites in general, it certainly gets the backs up of the humanist Christians, Jews, degenerates and their enablers. It calls their actions into question and deflates their egos. The WBC certainly serve their purpose, even if they're not entirely on mark. The only issue that fascists and like minded people could really take issue with is their anti-patriotism and I actually think that's a good thing; as a nationalist I don't feel the need to defend and excuse the current and past wrong doings of our leaders under the guise of ""patriotism"", I fight for what my nation once was and what it could be once again, not the current order. I have no unconditional love for a nation that champions the rights of fags, sells its inheritance to foreigners and works against god. WBC are quick to call out hypocrisy, degeneracy and tolerance; people don't like the fact that they tell it how it is written, that they're going to hell if they don't repent and carry on allowing it, it offends peoples' sensitivities and egos. I probably wouldn't be in your face as much as they are but it's the truth. They're master trolls and they're the best at showing up the hypocrisy of so-called ""1st amendment"" defenders and Libertarians. Freedom of speech for everyone except Westboro Baptist Church. They should be the best friends of any sincere and right-wing Christian. By all accounts I've heard from people that went to spend time with them, they're actually a nice and caring family with a strong bond amongst each other. Now apparently that's evil while queer adoption and indoctrination in self-destructive leftism isn't. If you were to implement biblical law and values and shun sin I bet WBC would be the biggest nationalists going. The moment I saw one of their notorious signs, all I could say was ""FUCK YES!"" it was refreshing to see people who weren't going to just accept it. Here are some more of their websites which I love: http://godhatesfags.com/ http://www.godhatesthemedia.com/ - very good one http://www.signmovies.com/ http://www.jewskilledjesus.com/ http://www.priestsrapeboys.com/ (Catholics won't like this one for obvious reasons) http://www.americaisdoomed.com/"
"my Commonwealth of The Bahamas flag on my wall, These commie bastards are gonna get rekt, the RBDF will probably be deployed and round them up, sending them to Her Majesty's Prison in Nassau, has some of the worst prison conditions in the world. BYE BYE HUMAN RIGHTS YOU YUPPIE RETARDS KEEP YOUR AMERICAN IMPERIALISM OUT OF MY ISLANDS!"
"Timothy McVeigh was a psychotic gun nut who read the Turner Diaries, but didn't really believe anything other than the government is getting too powerful. The point of Jewish control and degeneracy went right over his head. He then bombed a federal building with low level civilian workers in it, accomplishing nothing for his point. The media likes to paint him as right wing and one of us to make us all look like crazy psychos. He wasn't one of us, he was most likely a libertarian, didn't know anything about what we actually stand for, and just picked up a copy of a book written by one of us for some reason, thought the message was ""Big government is getting too powerful"" (I don't deny our government is doing things it shouldn't, but that wasn't the main point of the Turner Diaries, and McVeigh obviously failed to see it), and then he though the best was to combat the government is to do a lone wolf attack on a low level government office. Sir Anders Breivik, on the other hand, killed communists and I love that."
"Charles Coughlin Born to Irish Catholic parents in Ontario, Father Coughlin was one of the first political figures to use radio to spread his message. He was profoundly anti-jewish and anti-capitalist. His radio show was popular and reached millions of listeners until it was shut down Short Doc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqQpNb2pu4M Him speaking with another American Fascist Figure Huey Long https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfu_pLb0swA Wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Coughlin"
"humans have a “predisposition” to believe in some kind of divine being and in the afterlife; to be religious. Such beliefs are, indeed, part of what makes us human and are innate rather than learned, Atheist lack this. They are on the same level as the faggots, they are freaks and as the lack human nature probly also explains why most of them are liberal asses."
"The SHARP training program within the army. My god. This is the most PC-feminist shit I have ever read, and this is within the Army. I may just be signing out of this program since I'm not contractually obligated yet, thank god. I will find another way to pay for college because I will not be a part of this shit. These guys don't know their heads from their asses, and we're breeding them to be social justice nuts, not soldiers, not warriors, but faggots. And after the shit I got this morning after discovering that I've been getting orders from the wrong squad leader after being ""assigned to the wrong squad"" but that's *my* fault... that's a separate issue. Apparently I answered one of the questions wrong by saying I ""didn't think dirty jokes contributed to a sexually hostile environment."" The other highlight: You could be committing rape if your partner changes his/her mind during or after sex. My personal favorite: A woman saying ""I'm not sure about this"" or ""I'm not sure I want to do this here"" is saying ""no"" and if you continue, you are committing sexual assault. EDIT: also, there is such a thing as ""Accidentally committing rape""."
"Wib this is the liberal degeneration topic, and a warning was provided - though I agree when posting a point should have been made in conjunction. Example: this is a 'boytaur' (NSFW) - it is the worst example of liberal degeneracy. I have no clue what the hell this was about though."
Welcome. You will have to realize that this is an unapologetic fascist forum. The Confederate States were founded on classic Liberalism and fought against the counter-revolutionary (1776) Federalists. Both ideologies are opposed by the Fascist world view. That being said it is nice to meet someone from Mississippi. My family had a plantation in Batesville both before and after the Civil War. My ancestors did their duty for N.B. Forrest especially at Brice's crossroads. I'm very proud of that.
I have a policy of ignoring essentially all mainstream conservative figureheads that exist partially to just aggravate and bare the wrath of liberadouches.
Yeah fuck the fuck off you corn boy free market piece of crap. Take you're ideology and shove it up you're corn-boy mily-licking ass.
"What a copout.. I don't think so, NO compromise with Commies. That would just keep the Eastern Krauts enslaved and the politburo fatter with access to good quality Capitalist goods from our markets."

"I know what YOU think needs to be done but thats all socialist garbage that has never work and will never work. socialism breeds sloth and every one with half a brain cell knows it. Profit sharing, why would I want to do something that stupid? workers already get paid a fair market wage and by giving them more money they will just blow it while business owners will invest it back into the economy productively. once you take away private ownership there is no incentive for a true businessmen to do anything productive, he will just fuck off like the other works cause theres nothing in it for him in the long run. read some mises or friedman for god's sake."
I WARNED YOU ABOUT LEFTISTS BRO
"Strategy For Revolution - Joseph Tommasi On March 2nd, 1974, forty-three National Socialist Revolutionaries met in a hall in El Monte, California. At the meeting the National Socialists declared their lack of faith in the losing strategy of the mass movement idea. The National Socialists abandoned the mass strategy and adopted the revolutionary concept of the guerrilla underground. • No longer would we think in terms of obtaining political power through the electorate; but instead, of hurting the Enemy through force and violence. We would build the armed struggle. • We would no longer adhere to a mass strategy but would instead cultivate those already committed to the National Socialists World View. We have limited ourselves to only the best among Movement people. • We have abandoned petty bourgeois, bureaucratic hang-ups and have developed the idea that the end justifies the means. What works is good! • We recognize that women have played a vanguard role in most revolutionary efforts and involve them in every aspect of NSLF. • We recognize the fact that the masses of Whites will never rally around radical politics. White people no longer have the ability to even recognize the enemy, so how could Movement adherents think the masses could ever involve themselves in revolution? The White masses don't recognize their enemies, they don't even care, and they don't have the guts to shed their bourgeois hang-ups. • We view armed struggle as the only effective means of forcing political change. The White Man has lost! We are an occupied people in our own land who must now develop a totally different outlook on revolution. We must build the underground. We are making it an effective, hard-hitting National Socialist Revolutionary Army. We have already begun to launch armed assaults against the Enemy. More assaults will continue, whether the Enemy be the Right Wing Reactionaries, the System, or the Communists. National Socialist Ideological and Political training, additional training in guerrilla warfare, explosives and demolition, military assault weapons and gas warfare, along with electronic communications and electronic surveillance techniques are taking place. Classes in first aid, police evasion, techniques of being a P.O.W. and escape are also taking place. The NSLF is divided into combat units. A combat unit consists of three liberation fighters and a unit leader. No one combat unit knows who constitutes another combat unit. An NSLF combat unit member is trained as an efficient guerrilla fighter dedicated to destroying the Enemy, no matter who that enemy may be. On the surface he has no uniform. He could be the bearded long-hair sitting next to you on the bus, or the clean-cut store clerk. He could be anyone anywhere. The NSLF has the best elements gathered together from the past twenty years of National Socialist activity in the United States. It has gathered experienced communications experts, military firearms experts, along with the finest liberation fighters available. Each member understands the new concept, the new strategy and tactics needed in order to effect political change. No longer willing to play the games of Movement bureaucracies or associating with bald-headed idiots who have no concept of realities, the NSLF will undoubtedly emerge the vanguard fighters in the National Socialist Revolution!"
"Thank you, my African brother! Long live the DPRK! I hope i will liberate my country from the chinese and american liberasts."
"Apply those ideas and every single fucking third world worker is dead, and thank god. That's why they're not capitalistic. Conglomerations on lines of superior traits have always stamped out divided and competing reactionaries; that is how capitalism overtook the world and that is how National Socialism will overtake the jews. derp. merkuh isn't a nation, it's a sewer burn it to the ground #rekt #spic /thread"
"Violent insurrection? Only 1/3rd of the US population at the time fought, the others either fought FOR the British or just stayed neutral. The US was born because a bunch of rationalist inspired wanks found an excuse to fight a rationalist liberal constitutional monarchy. Nations are formed by a common people moved by their blood to conquer, grow and seed the soil. Some of the colonists might have fought for such an ideal but there were also others who fought for money and abstract notions of liberty. We're not enlightened, we're just not blinded by American patriodardism. Your opinions are rooted on a false premise. That the US is salvageable as an entity. It is not, because the US was built on ideals that are the complete antithesis to what Fascism strives for. You'll need to read the materials, its mandatory if you earnestly want to understand what Fascism is. The truth is a cosmic principle, it is given by God. It is natural law. Tradition is the means by which a certain race aspire to that truth. You can notice this by how many traditions believe in the sin of homosexuality or race-mixing for example. No matter if pagan or Christian or whatever, there is a certain worldview that we hold to. One that denies the suicidal beliefs of the enlightenment. The anti-life ideas of the Jew. ""All men are created equal"". This was said by one of America's founders and it is among the most anti-traditional and most anti-traditional notions ever. And I agree, that's why the American Futurism workshop even exists. There is no Fascist way to power for any American wanting to preserve the USA. The United States of America is at its root nothing like any other state. If you destroyed the German constitution you will still have the German people. China has had dozens of governments but the concept of China still exists. The Civil War almost destroyed the idea of the USA, the thought a state can democratically elect to leave the Union is alien to any nation with a blood and soil character. The disintegration of the US is the best thing to happen to any American because it allows them to truly create a distinct American racial identity instead of being chained to piece of toilet paper like the Constitution. How many states can survive without federal aid? California would be fucked, the Midwest would die. The only states that can survive by its own is Texas and the New England states. This paragraph highlights the divide between American patriots and American fascists. This is why I said that a Dixie Fascist Nation or a Pacific Northwest Nation can exist. You think of government while I'm talking about race-culture. There is no race-culture that dominates the US. It's Yankees, Dixies, Californians and etc. The South has a distinct race-culture. Even when it's infested with niggers there is still a common volkgeist. If the Civil War was won by the Confederates than you could have seen possible organic nations developing in North America. It began when it started. The United States was formed with the idea that a federal centralized government would play second fiddle to the power of the states. But that didn't turn out great with economy disasters and a weak sovereignty. The fact that the US had to compromise its beliefs so early shows that it was so weak. The 1920's as a specific point in time doesn't make sense because the decline happened long before that. Then use that logic and rationalism. The system of the United States is defined by its adherence to the Constitution, it was developed with checks and balances. It was meant to be a system designed for status quo. Only a violent conflict can lead to permanent changes because eventually the left will take back power of the system and undo everything the right has done. Decades of partisan back and forth and nothing has changed. The game is rigged and the only way to win is to kick the table under. Is violence a logical means of doing it? Is it rational to think that the US government can be beat? Maybe not. But Fascism is limited by rationality. Any Fascist can enjoy their life, be hedonistic and not care at all. In this modern world we can access anything we want, so why are Fascist so discontent? Why can't we enjoy all the sick pleasures like every other normal person? It's because we are disgusted and horrified by the degeneracy rife in this world. The moral decay of civilization and the degradation of our races. These are not rational feelings born of the mind but born from the soul and heart."
"Will check this out. I usually hate anime, but I recently began watching Legend of the Galactic Heroes, as people on /pol/ shilled hard for it. This is the episode that drew me in, its just a flashback/documentary episode about the lore, so I checked it out, and its about a far right politician that takes over the space republic and turnes into a tradical empire,and purged all degenerates. And then in the ""present times"", the tradical empire is fighting a rebel faction of corrupt shekel loving democracts in epic space battles. Apparently there are Jews in it too"
"I told them the fact that BLM was funded by a Capitalistic Jew, that has caused the migrant crisis and financial crisis we face today in Denmark and Europe. I asked them why they would bring a terror organzation like BLM to Denmark? If it was so they could scream white racism to every white person in Denmark like they do in the USA. Or if they could fuss about some racist comment on facebook made by a avg Dane concerned about the well-being of his people in HIS OWN country. Then I told them if they were really worried about black lives why did they not focus on all the gang violence, abortion and STD's that black people are plagued by. Instead of something petty as a 1-2 black men shot by the police in the USA because they did not comply with the police. Her argument was that I should not start I debate so that the next time we meet it would be awkward because I would something along the lines like you do not care about black people. Then she took my comment out of context like should we make a status on facebook everyday about black lives should that help maybe??? And then she went on about how I acted like some kind of smartass that acted like I knew it all, and then told me she could care less about my opinion. The somali went on about muh racism, The usa was founded on racism bla bla bla, and how the CIA or government inflitarted crack into the black neigherborhoods and watched them like laboratory rats, and finally twisted my argument again(about the one with petty protest about 1-2 men shot by police) that noone should be shot because of their culture,race or religion you know the usual liberal shit."
"Yep and if you were born a nigger you would think that your nigger race is superior as well? National Socialists didn't ""espouse Nordicism"" because they are Nordic, they espoused it because it's fucking true. You can't be a fascist if you just lie to yourself and ignore reality, that would make you a liberal."
"It's sexually perverse and promotes effeminate behavior amongst men. Furthermore, the gay rights movement is an extension of the liberal movement, meaning ""gay rights"" also propagates leftism and materialism."
"I disagree, in VNN there is a lot of serious people, anyway, LGBT and ""egalitarian"" marriage hit Brazil this year, a lot of states already approve it. What would we expect from a government ruled by a commie-bitch?. Also, there is a stupid deputy called ""Jean Wyllys"", he is just in the government because he won a reality show and is gay, now he is th biggest activist on LGBT moviment."
"No they're not. Muslims living in western nations are the most whiny and hypocritical shits - they appeal to liberalism and religious pluralism whenever it suits them, but turn a blind eye towards the savage customs and behavior of their coreligionists. In virtually every western nation where they reside, muslims have allied themselves to social democrats and the far left. There should be no tolerance for these parasites."
"Asked them to stop???? Only a liberal gelding would do any less than stomp their skulls into jelly. God, I just really hate rapists"
"preach bruh if there has to be one guy to be gassed right now in this moment, it should and inshallah be blackcock 13 for sure. I'm happy this has happened but I feel all we will get out of it is kosher parties getting bigger. I think everything in NS that is good, noble, and positive is in Islam except Islam is of God and NS is of men. I feel Islam can fit with any culture really but a lot of people here are stuck in this idea that they want to take down western civilization and that is bad. That is actually good because western civilization is in decline... You can't salvage it at all... it needs to be destroyed quickly. Defending western civilization is defending democracy, feminism, and faggotry. Don't do it man. Also don't forget that the kosher right nationalists hate Islam but love Israel. Islam is a good ally against jews."
"Hey everyone, it's great to be here. I'm a 17 year old Nationalist from California who's looking to become more involved in nationalist and fascist social circles. I grew up in a highly conservative and religious family, and through my teenage years I somewhat rebelled against the ideas my father taught me, drifting from conservatism and Christianity in favor of agnosticism and socialism. Looking back on those years, I'm somewhat disgusted that I allowed my opinions to be shaped so much by nothing more than emotion and peer pressure. The older I become, the more I see the corruption and degeneracy of the world around me, all controlled by an isolated, out of touch liberal elite. Living in California, almost everyone I know is liberal. I have become convinced that liberalism is a mental illness, that liberalism turns one against one's own kind, that liberalism breeds hatred against the institutions that have laid the framework for modern society to function. While those on the far-right may desire massive changes to the system, they still maintain that their nation, the nation that gave them everything they have, is great and worth defending. Liberals on the other hand seek only to destroy what has been built, as they believe the United States, my country, is evil and must pay for the past ""atrocities"" it has committed. Now, with terrorist groups like Antifa and Black Lives Matter actively assaulting and censoring the voices of the right (and really anyone who disagrees with them) I know that it's time to fight fire with fire. In a few months I will be graduated from high school, and then I will move on to study organic chemistry at a local college, pursuing my American dream. I intend to be an active part in fascist and nationalist political movements in the future, and I will be prepared to fight the good fight. Cheers."
"I think 2-3 of my libtardiest friends deleted me on jewbook after I defended NS/Hitler/xenophobia for the first time, still see them a few times a year but they always act like we are still on very good terms, no one would ever say anything to my face Everyone that knows me knows what I'm about, parents refuse to believe I'm a nazi, just a gud boi going through a 'phase' or smth The only reactions I've ever gotten from acquaintances (at university) though were pure indifference. Word for word in my first year of university: So you believe in the supremacy of the Aryan race? Cool. That was the funniest one. Even wrote papers on 'Jewish privilege' when the assignment was either white privilege or male privilege. Showed it to some guy that always sat with me in class and it turned out he was a Jew. Awkward, haha. There was a commie chick in my second year that I was doing a project on communism with. After the initial shock wore off that I was actually a Nazi , we were sitting in the library and she tried telling me that there wasn't any difference between races and multiculturalism was some sort of natural progression. Told her to look around the library at groups sitting at tables, sure enough, races self segregated. Anyways, after a bunch of these kinds of conversations she admitted communism could never work. 1st year again, there was a club fair and I was walking around checking everything out. Run into two guys I knew through one of my friends, they are shilling for 'farthest right' political party in my province. So we started talking and after I tell them I am not interested in political parties, and that I am a fascist one of them wholeheartedly agrees with me, meanwhile Johnny McLemming goes like 'h-heh, y-yeah, fascism is g-great', still well acquainted with both of them. Anyways I have lots more stories but you get the idea, haven't ever been given any trouble"
"You can't get into it because it doesn't make sense unless you see democracy as the rule of the people and the state as the ultimate representation of the people that is ruled by a supreme leader that is the very manifestation of his people's will. Also you're annoying because you seem to write wall of texts without saying much and trough that generally being annoying. Stuck at the stage where one thinks you know best on everything. When someone claims to know better of a subject and make fundamental errors due to lack of understanding or lack of knowledge, the arrogance of said person thinking he would know is rather annoying. I've been on both ends of that coin so I know what I talk about here. If some retarded neo pagan would come up and say ''jesus was a gay loving faggot that died because he was too weak LOL'' I would cringe, laugh or get annoyed because said person don't have a basic understanding of the Bible. If someone who has not read Spengler insist that Spengler meant X because of Y and therefore democratic communism is the way to go, that would be retarded because I've read Spengler + democratic communism sounds faggy and autistic. If I would suddenly think to know better than an electrician on the issue of my light in my bathroom, I should not be suprised if he gets a bit grumpy. Little did you know your fedora is basically a menorah because you have not read evola~~ Banter aside. Take it easy and get to the point of why you think you're unique special view is more sane than the Evola-tipper's."
"As fun as it is pointing out the hilarity of leftists getting bitten by their own pets. I much prefer to exploit their deaths for propaganda. Muslims taking out leftist trash, causing tensions allowing Nationalists and Fascists to point the finger. There isn't much these leftists would hate more than the very people they despise using their deaths as a platform for radical far right reaction. Even more hilarious is the media reaction claiming this is an attack on ""f-f-f-free sp-sp-speech"" and ""f-f-freedom."" That passive talk isn't working as well as it use to, there is too much anger to simply misdirect from the issue. Next weeks Pegida numbers are going to skyrocket."
"^^^ Yeah, that's basically my thinking. It makes more sense to try to regulate and contain than to try to eradicate entirely IMHO. That doesn't mean I want to live near heroin users or think it's OK for the state to be wasting resources on people that OD or whatever. With that said what makes marijuana so awful for the country isn't the drug's effects it's the subculture that's popped up around it. I remember a friend of mine once said that he'd prefer cocaine be legal before marijuana because coke attracted businessmen and alpha personalities while pot attracted white suburban losers, ghetto trash and liberal pukes. I kind of see his point, they really are nauseating."
"I'm not a rightwing retard, but this is what we nationalist are exploiting... Throught anti-communism hatred we will grow too fucking much. We are not the first, Baathism and Peronisms and even National-Socialism, were heavily influenced by leftism! but they knew it when too attack commies, to gain power! We really use hard rightwing rethoric. The problem with a rightist aproach are the methods. Rightwing is cuckish and impotent... Venezuelan National Armed Forces Rangers units, known as Cazadores, used to trow communists from helicopters. Venezuelan General Sectorial Directorate of Services of Intelligence and Prevention, used to murder the reds in big quantities. Trowing red from chopters is a latinoamerican tradition..."
"Killing Palastinians with white phosperous agitates the Arabs. The liberalism is spreading and the Israeli people are destroying themselves. The IDF does a terrible job in suppressing liberalism. If Israel was sane it would be similar to how Greece was from 1967–1974. I can see the people of Israel welcoming their destruction with open arms if the do not clean themselves from liberalism. The state of Israel is not even really Zionist, it is an insane regime. Both the USA and Israel cause eachother more harm then good. That insane nuclear rogue state that occupies Palastine loves to kill anti-Zionists(many who are liberals) as long as they are not Jewish. 2 and 4 for example. http://palestinechronicle.com/view_article_details.php?id=17182"
"Wait… we can't use the word “retarded” anymore? Didn't these very same people push for the use &amp; adoption of the words “mentally retarded” like 15 years ago as a “politically correct” substitute for other terms? And now it's offensive, because guess what… it's used to refer to potatoes, and now has a negative (as it should) connotation. So, whatever fucking terminology they want us to adopt now is eventually going to become just as “offensive”, apparently, as saying “mentally retarded”, or using the word “retarded” as an adjective. God, I fucking hate liberals. It just makes me want to use the word even more, and I will. Fuck them. Anyway, enjoy the video. Lots of hilarious degenerate retards bawwwing that people call them retards."
"Did they sign up for those reasons? Absolutely not. They were misled,used and thrown away literally like garbage, we feel empathy for them because they are our countrymen, but we won't be continuing their mistakes. That's why we're pissed and sad to hear this, it's an unfortunate thing, they fought for ZOG without realizing it, we're not sad because ''muh freedums'' or ''muh 9/11'', we're sad because they were used. This is the reason why Cuckservatives are the worst, they use these young men for kike interests while brainwashing them about 'muh freedums' and 'muh dibersity'. I hope they rest in peace, but I hope they realize they were used in the here after, along with Americans that died in WW1 and WW2."
"Intellect, Instinct &amp; Personal Loyalty This is about how real leadership works. Not good administration but real leadership. Since last year I've had as an acquaintance a young lady whose company I enjoy very much but who, unfortunately, is a hopeless liberal. You may first ask why in the hell I waste my time with her and I would respond that, one, the mere fact that she continues the relationship indicates she has a spark of life left somewhere and, two, it is the best way to learn the workings of the human heart and mind. Besides, it's entertaining and it breaks the boredom. First, she's top-notch racially, being primarily Germanic. Second, she's a brilliant conversationalist which is damned rare in this one-mule town. She's one of the System's primary victims yet, at the same time, one of the System's most outspoken advocates. (I was also told by another comrade that we happen to be totally opposed astrologically, if that means anything.) Anytime the conversation turns to politics she ends up screaming, stomping out of the room, slamming doors, etc., etc.. Later, she'll say how it upsets her to allow herself to become so frustrated while I never ruffle a feather at all her name-calling once her ""facts and arguments"" all draw blanks and I start walking all over taboos and superstitions popularly held sacred today. According to her– and to her kind of course– I'M the problem; poisoning, subverting, befouling the workings of the ""Great Democracy"". There's something wrong with ME! That's why things are so irrevocably, inexplicably screwed up in the country and the world. True liberal logic. Jews and the System know how to play these people like a violin. Commander Rockwell said that it was because of the high level of development of the abstract virtues or ""advanced instincts"" of charity, decency and fair play found exclusively among the best racial types within the White Race. The Jews have done an almost complete job of perverting these instincts into the Negro-worshipping mania that is everywhere today. But it's tough to feel sorrow, much less kinship, for anyone who'll sneer at you and say that they have an intelligence quotient of a hundred and forty and, therefore, they know it all and, furthermore, any Negro that comes along with and equally high I.Q. is just as good as you or I, maybe even better. To seemingly further illustrate her argument, I never make any bones about the fact that I left school at the age of sixteen and made my way to Party headquarters. She, of course, has had several years of college. Still, she can't nail me in facts and principles. And only after I thoroughly debunked to her the merit of so-called ""I.Q."" in my own terms, according to my own values, did l tell her that when last tested by the public schools at the age of about fourteen, my I.Q. far exceeded hers when last tested as an adult. My argument against pure intellect, or I.Q., or the placing of too much emphasis on its importance, is simply that it is but one more physical attribute, or blessing, if you will, to be USED by the possessor. And it can be used for good or evil. Most of the slimy bastard, lawyer-politicians ruling this land today have exceptionally high I.Q.'s. It only enables them to tighten and maintain their ruthless and destructive hold over the rest of us. A really high I.Q. can be compared to weighing five-hundred pounds, or having three arms, or four legs, etc. Depending on the circumstances it can be a blessing or a curse. Jews, of course, as a group are known for their power of intellect. So what does this prove? That intellect is only a tool to be used, or a weapon to be wielded. Used or wielded by what higher power? Nobody ever heard tell of a ""noble intellect"". Intellect doesn't MOVE people, if anything it serves to hold them back from bold and daring action. A stone coward– by use of his intellect– can come up with a thousand perfectly plausible covers for his cowardice. The same swine that hold political office today use intellect to swamp the simple people in massive confusion and colors of gray. The lone, intelligent individual, many of who are to be found in the Right, may have sat down and sorted it all out for themselves but to what avail? Because again, intellect cannot mobilize the masses. People are largely unthinking. Of what benefit was intellect to any guy out to seduce some female? Hitler himself told us that the masses are feminine in nature. Of what good is intellect to its owner in the instant that sudden violence occurs? Instinct– a healthy instinct– stands second only to pure blood in vital importance. Hitler in Mein Kampf said that loyalty took precedence over intelligence, and loyalty is but one by-product of instinct. Aside from pure blood, nobility is found in the instinct. Facts can be distorted but the ""sixth sense""– where it exists strong and unsullied– is well-nigh impossible to deceive. Instinct is the product of eons of evolution. So-called “intellect"" is measured by the amount of ""information"" one can store in one's head, whether that ""information"" be essential or rubbish. When it comes down to male/female relations, it's a matter of what animal signals are sent out and how well the other party senses these. In combat– animal, one-on-one combat– instinct takes over completely and the intellect shuts down so as not to impede the organism in successfully fighting to preserve its existence. Only man in his ignorance, pride and conceit, his off-base worldview with himself as the center of the universe and above Natural Law, has made possible the awful mess people are living in today. But did you ever notice how people with healthy instincts rarely need to be propagandized or otherwise ""straightened out""? Those who require propagandizing can only at best hope to make up a class of distant followers, never leaders. Leaders and the Leadership Cadre itself must be able to serve as their own guiding light and their own inspiration, they cannot be skaters who need to lean on anyone else or be carried when times are tough (""Nobody ever told me it might be like this!""). Total instinctive awareness is far superior to any number of years in a university. Can instinct be cultivated and can it be dulled? I rather think so and I am certain the Jews think so too, which is the reason for such things as ""Project Head Start"" and the general program of school bussing. To kill off the instinct before it has a chance to grow. To what extent the artificially created drug plague plays a role in this can only be estimated but I feel it must be devastating. Regardless of the degree of any success the Jews and the System may have had or shall have in the future in making the walking dead out of otherwise healthy, happy human beings, the number that somehow manages to hold on– through some fortuitous genetic twist– and resist the poison will respond to the call when it comes from the right Leader. The rest, as we can clearly see already today, are of no use anyway. But what I refer to as the proper Leader or the proper lead is just that. It is not one more poor man's sneaky attempt at a clever charade or club activity. Far less is it an exercise in counter-culture revisionist thinking. It is a call to ACTION. It will be a call for millions of people to lay down their lives. It had better ring true. Most of all it is a call to action by those currently ACTING on their own. I've said in the past that when it really starts to happen it will happen FAST. Right at the moment nothing is happening. Nothing except our enduring this most tiresome, agonizing and potentially discouraging phase of the struggle when nerves and spirits are tested to the utmost. The instinct for action cannot be fooled. It will not respond to a false alarm. Nothing half-hearted will strike fire. I've seen many small sparks made. I've seen the pattern of how it works. When the current is running through you– and only then– it can be transmitted to others and the process of making an army has started. I did it myself again last month and worked a last-minute miracle in court. Of the small army I contacted the night before, not a single one failed me. Some got out of sick beds, others left their jobs in order to be in court at 8:30 am, in order to be there for that purpose. A real purpose, not bullshit. That sort of thing can only happen fast. Dragging it out will kill it surer than any action by the Enemy. And what has the Right Wing been known for these umpteen decades other than DRAGGING IT THE HELL OUT?? People get TIRED. Jam tired but I also happen to be one of the tiny few whose guts are on fire permanently. Most people don't have the capacity or the desire for that. Massive-scale, high-performance output can only be maintained for short periods. A successful revolutionary will know how to get it, how to direct it and how to secure rapid results before it dies down. Look at the 1905 aborted revolution in Russia, or the Munich Putsch, or the so-called ""revolution"" of the Sixties. Other than members of the hardcore, the rest will respond only to a visible, known and familiar Leader figure. And down through the ranks that pattern will follow. Personal loyalty has historically been what the ""hinge of fate"" has turned upon. Owing to the split-second dynamics (historically speaking) of great revolutionary movements, this is well and good. Lenin lived the bulk of his fifty-odd years in comparative obscurity, as an exile. But he was the Man In Time for the Russian Revolution, and afterwards only lived a scant six more years. Hitler knew that as Leader of the world's most crucial revolution he had to move fast lest he die and his revolution flounder without him. ""He spoke with the eloquence of emergency"", and the current which ran strong through him was conveyed to all of Germany. Those who are already committed to the struggle, whether win or lose– these are the ones who need propagandizing and politicking so as to hone themselves up to maximum ability. If we try that on people who are already waiting for the Leader to appear so that they may follow him, we will alienate and lose them. THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT. Hell, I don't want to hear it. If anything, the instinct is the only ""soul"" any of us will ever know. The only God any of us has exists in our bloodstream. Let us hope that the God within will provide our souls the answer to the dilemma we face and give us the strength to lead our people. When we begin to lead naturally then a hundred years of brainwash and distortion will be smashed in an instant. [Vol. XII, #9– Sept., 1983]"
"Hi everyone! My name is Robert I'm from England originally (London) but I live in Australia now with my family, moved here 3 years ago. I've been a national socialist for just on 2 years now and what helped me a lot with my understanding of what National Socialism is all about was watching documentaries like the greatest story never told, one third of the holocaust, Hell storm, a documentary on how Israel, Mossad, and the Jew's we're behind 9/11 etc.... it's literally opened up a door for me and has helped me a lot with my understanding on how governments and mass media corrupt our thinking. I know that the Jew's are definitely trying to frame Assad to try and get rid of him by saying that he's gassed his own people which is absolutely bool shit and I know that it's bool shit cause I thought about it and worked it out for myself by doing my own investigation. Besides how could Assad gas his own people when his own people like him? People die as soon as Sarin gas touches them so those photos that were in the newspaper (Mercury) is fake. The chemical weopons that we're used in Syria are weopons that the rebels have used in the past. I also think that Saddam Hussein and Gaddafi we're great leaders as well. Gaddafi helped to stabilize Africa and helped people get cheap petrol prices. I dislike Putin cause he's a Jew and a commie. It was the Jew's who created commies and to me all commie's are disgusting. I'll leave it at that for the time being Cheers Robert"
"I'm starting to support him because this is quickly turning into a battle about ""white privilege"". All of the token monkeys, spics, liberals, kikes and the odd Asian on TV are bringing up this angle and talking about how it's unfair and that a PoC farmer would never get away with this, this is clearly an example of a system that favors white males and an example of white male entitlement, etc."
"One more example of how liberals have the mind of a child. The autism of the average SJW is so crippling that they haven't developed past a 10 year old's moral reasoning. Liberals, just like children, parrot what they are told without question."
"The 10% ""statistic"" is a lie made up by Alfred Kinsey. Thew actual percentage is far lower. It depends on the country. I am sure in many liberal nations it may even be as high as 5% but in decent socially-conservative nations it is bellow 1%. Some people are naturally homosexuals but for the most part it is a learn't behavior. Many people are even naturally psychopaths. I have noticed a link between serial killers, homosexuality and sexual degeneracy in general. I am sure a large segment of the population depending on the nation has experimented, this is how sick the modern world is. I had a female friend who experimented a fair amount though she is mostly heterosexual. I stopped being her friend. Real shame, an attractive pleasant tall woman of Aryan decent. Many men in jail experiment with buggery. This is not only because there are no women in jail but criminals are more degenerate then decent law abiding folk. I would disagree. Metapedia has its flaws is a site that is more honest then wikipedia. I would say most information on wikipedia can be trusted but anyone can edit it and it is full of communist/liberal propaganda. Stalinists and oldschool patriotic communists dislike homosexuals. When a state becomes communist it always adopts Nationalism and social-conservatism. That wikipedia on ""communism and homosexuality""even acknoledges modern communism and homosexuality are linked: ""Most communists, especially in recent times, have argued that Gay liberation is a key issue according to Marxism"". Homosexuality and other degenerate behavior such as radical feminism are linked with communism and has been since the time of Magnus Hirschfeld if not before. I am aware of Rohm, apart from that 1 flaw he was a great man. Rohm was a leftist National Socialist and I would even call him a sexual Bolshevist(minus the communism). He was a homosexual nepotist who promoted his butt buddies to high positions. Every movement has its degenerates and corrupt individuals in all movements but it is mostly communist and communist influenced movements that pander to homosexuality a great deal. Identity politics work, that is why people use them. Homosexuals have their own form of psudonationalism, thats why they have ""gay pride"". The new left support nationalism or psudonationalism unless it is the nationalism of a group that ""oppresses"" eg whites and men. This man is an interesting characher. There are a few decent homosexuals just as their are decent pychopaths. Homosexuality is very unmanly IMO. I value manliness more so then womanhood. I prefer how women look but as an elitist genrally I would rather befriend men. In many ways they are superior to men(eg lower sex drive, less criminal ect) but women are more liberal and egalitarian. There are degenerates or people with degenerate characheristics in every movement. Rohm, Otto Rahn and Yukio Mishima both had 1 great flaw. Mussolini was a womaniser but that is not that degenerate, quite a miunor flaw. Hitler was almost entirely asexual, 1 of the many reasons I view him as almost a perfect human being."
Ironmarch is officially nazbol territory
"Ran out of thanks to give. Glad to hear you're keeping up the fight. My friend's in San cristobal, very agrarian manner of life up there, many of them nostalgic for Jiminez and his authoritarian style with an emphasis on anti-communism. Literally the only praise Chavez gets from fascists in Vz is his ""anti-Semitism"" which was pretty moderate and a typical case of Jews blowing things out of proportion."
"But in fact a Fatwa is a non-binding juridicial advice made by a Mufti and therefore its not the word of Allah. So in fact this Fatwa must be seen in exactly the same context as the Talmud, because it represents a interpretation of a individual religious leader (which can contradict those of other religious leaders). That's quite a understatement considering its a bundling of interpretations on Judaist teachings of high ranking historic Jewish religous leaders. In that sense its a important guideline that shapes the religious Jewish philosophy and argumentation. Therefore it gives a good insight in general religious Jewish thought including some of its excesses. I suggest you delve into Islam next to Judaism before making such claims, because as I stated before this Fatwa does not represent the word of Muhammad (which would be the word of Allah to be exact), but that of a individual religious leader. A ""religion of peace"" does not exist and all theocraties corrupt the masses. But Islam is not so different from her sisterbeliefs (Judaism and Christianity) although certainly some more militant (not really suprising considering the situation in which this religion arose). Anyone with the slightest historical insight should agree. But you create a very out of context and incorrect view by blaming all this violence simply on Islam as a religion without taking in account all the other factors that contribute to these events. With your ""logic"" according to Europol statistics nationalism would be the objectionable violent ideology with 85% of terrorist attacks against 0,4% Islamic terrorist attacks (not to mention the 7% terrorist attacks by extremist Jews agaisnt 6% by Islamic extremists in the USA according to the FBI). So I would call it a tempest in a teapot - nothing more then simplistic propaganda for the less gifted... I know, I'm simply stating that Muslims aren't the only religous group that stays caught in ""outdated"" traditions. Its mainly the sucking of baby dicks I find repulsive, just as planting a bomb in the A-hole. As you admit yourself every religious group knows its own nutcases. I don't think that Islamic martyrs believe that shoving a bomb up their ass will spread Islam and therefore believe that this claim is nothing more then anti-Islam propaganda and thus completly insignificant from a political point of view."
"I would disagree. Back in those days people were more racist so such behavior is more acceptable then it is now. Maybe the uniforms were a mistake. They should have made new uniforms that were distinctly American. Rockwell wanted racial separation and allied himself with black nationalists. That is a common goal. I can not see different race in the USA sharing a nationalism, thats unrealistic. For the most part different races are loyal to their race first. Yes, Theodore as well as Huey were a great man and I would say the same about his Fifth cousin FDR. America was corporatist under him. In order to beat National Socialism and Fascism the allies even had to become semi-fascist. Ok. In America I am sure mixed whites and some non-whites may be accepted in fascist movements. The WN movement is mislead. Its full of libertarian fools. Muh individualism, muh freedom ect."
"""those guys are mean, fucking commies ; (((("" wew"
"Our German class has a ""culture"" element and the professor actually asked what the most pressing things about German Culture are. What comes to mind. My suggestions were Industry, Philosophy, and Heritage. The most pressing and upsetting matters about Germany for the rest of the class is ""Nazism, Racism towards Immigrants, and Rammstein."" What the fuck do you guys expect? This is one of the greatest countries that ever existed being completely subverted and destroyed by the kikes and the marxists. Destruction of culture, destruction of nationalism, and the discouragement and even persecution of any patriotic or national sentiments by its people."
"You seem like a cool dude but you have to give up on the hippy white nationalist-tier bullshit. I get extremely mad everytime someone who claims to be fascist and at the same time uses the cuck arguments of the defeatists. ""I don't hate other races, I love mine"". ""We are not agressive, we are protecting what is ours"". Mindfarts. This quote by Mussolini sums it up pretty well and is all you need tbh. Otherwise, you sound like those anti-trump idiots who fight his ""hate"" with their ""love"". Ugh. Good stuff, keep up the good work. So far so good. This is okay but Varg is heavily autistic. He is like a walking contradiction - he is right for some things but for some others he is MILES away from them. I'd encourage people to wear his permaculture/survivalism/traditions stuff but avoid his comments on pretty much everything else. Having more white babies per se is not a bad thing but qui bono if they are just going to become the new generation of degenerate lemmings ? The problem is not the hwyte geNOcide, the problem is the consumerist mentality, the spoiled and carefree capitalist existance of the modern man. As long as the system exists, everything else is of lesser priority. Because the collapse of the system is the only way for us to survive. The situation is like an unconventional warfare - war with different tactics/methods. It is us or them. Check the materials and the articles and of course the Unholy Bible - Siege by Mason. Also, you might want to check the Esoteric Hitlerist thread because I've also started my journey in a simmilar to yours way. And welcome, of course."
"Wish they would have given the fascist/roman salute. But seriously, this is great the only thing that could have made this better was if they had beat up some immigrants or antifa fags."
"Ironmarch seems to pull in a lot of former Communists, which I find quite amusing due to Fascism being totally anti-Communism. However, I was a formerly a pro-Capitalist so I suppose I can't talk much. Anyway, welcome to the forums!"
"I'm ok with a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, but make it all of Asia, so it should be Greater Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. We still should keep our own identities, but at least we want to keep ourselves as a fortress against liberastism. I do not like how the Japanese did it (posting troops in our land), so i would have my own ideas about it. First, countries that support Pan Asianism, should lead other Asians. But we should still keep our cultures intact. The Japanese idea about it sounded Noble, but they were hypocrites as well. So how about this, yes, we let the Japanese lead us as well, but that doesn't mean it is an excuse to turn us as vassal states. Same with the Chinese/other nations. We still want an independence for all of our nations. Issues regarding with other nations outside of Asia (Russians, Africans, Europeans, Americans), must be talked about by Asians."
"I don't really think conservativism has much to do with fascism other than being fed up with liberal retardedness. That being said though... Practically everyone that's smart and young seems to be ""fascistlike"" these days, however, smart people are a minority - ussually having a smart phone is enough replacement for their lack of intelligence."
This cesspit of a country was founded on liberal values - it was fucced since day 1. Parliamentarian representative democracy is a stain on the entire human species
"Note: I didn't respond to every part as this was addressed to Vlad in the first place. Theodor W. Adorno was good buds with Max Horkheimer and is one of the vermin to crawl from the Frankfurt School. His little theory on what constitutes an authoritarian personality has more to do with his anti-Western, neo-leftist attitude than anything else. Also, you obviously didn't read on: ""Soon after the publication of The Authoritarian Personality, the theory became the subject of many criticisms. Theoretical problems involved the psychoanalytic interpretation of personality, and methodological problems focused on the inadequacies of the F-scale. Another criticism is that the theory of the Berkeley group insinuates that authoritarianism exists only on the right of the political spectrum. As a result, some have claimed that the theory is corrupted by political bias. Kreml found that the anti-authoritarian personality had the same personality characteristics as the authoritarian personality.[6] Congrats, you're an ebil fasheest like the rest of us. Or William Kreml is wrong on the basis of invalidating your argument. Daily Mail? Really? So we are to believe that liberals that viciously attack critics of immigration, for instance, in an emotional frenzy are completely sane and rational? Or what about anarchists who trash up neighborhoods, small businesses, attempt to start riots, and clash with police? Reasonable young gents, eh? The article is a total wank-job. If we suffer from fear and paranoia, you liberals suffer from xenophilia and autism. Pretending to be a psycho-analytic neurologist doesn't make you any more credible, just like an ass. And on corruption: ALL societies and governments corrupt over time. People lose sight of ideology and purpose; subversive influences set in. It is easy for you to sit back, claim the passive aggressive libertarian stance, and criticize any political ideology as you barely have one to claim. You have placed yourself on a moral plateau without actually having a solid foundation for said plateau. America tried a ""libertarian"" approach and we are in the same kind of decline as former kingdoms and republics of the West. Since when did we advocate any non-criminal person being forced to work somewhere they didn't want to? You are applying a caricature of Hitler's policies to us. Please stop. And what if people desire to work but instead become free to starve via libertarian private interest? But aren't you arguing that we are all about central planning? This says we are all for private profits and public bailouts of failing enterprises. Which is it? Your arguments against us are just copy-pasted wiki strawmen. And your ideology encourages subversion, limited participation in society, and degeneration. Look around you. We're living in an age of self-aggrandizing individualism. You wanted your libertarian society, you got it. Every politician appeals to the people in some sense. Democracy is the worst perpetrator of demagoguery. If any system is a failure on the basis of failed promises and economic disparity, then democracy is a failure. You won't deny democracy though, will you? Again, I'll mention America. We had limited government and guess what? We expanded greatly via EVAAALLLL imperialism, we fought in a good number of wars, we acquired many resources, and now we are in great decline in almost every sense of the word. Your limited government ideal of democracy and playing nice has little bearing in the real world. No government lasts forever, democratic ones just disappear faster, as they are open to subversion and plutocratic interest. Western countries doing fine? Perhaps in a materialistic, comfy lifestyle sense. Culturally, socially, politically, etc.? Atrocious. Your logic is that every government has it's people in servitude, therefore they are raped and ravaged, therefore it is bad and the government has no legitimacy. So if it were up to you, there would be no civilization, as you seem to see any form of civic duty or action as oppression. Libertarians like yourself are knee-jerk moralists that claim folly of any public structure whilst offering no solutions yourself. Tell that to China buddy."
"""Fascism has nothing to do with environmentalism, environmentalism is for faggots. It's just another form of liberal hysteria and irrational fears."" Great logic there. Liberals are more worried about equality and other things, you faggot."
"My mission is complete, I triggered a wannabe-Croat Turk into writing wall of text just to fail to counter anythign written above. Well yeah It should be questioned since with all your supreme organization you didn't menaged to get rid of the communsits and Jews, while ""barbarians"" across Drina were proclaimed first Juden-free territory, and not to mention the success of SDK in completely destroying the red scum. That's my next topic. Ustashe and Communists, siblings in hatered for Serbs. &gt;bunch of text dealing with jews If you payed closed attention to the text, you would notice that no one is denying Jews were killed in NDH, it just exposes how infested the very top of NDH was with Jews and their role in the crimes against the Serbs. &gt;calls Serb barbarians &gt;Is a half Turk &gt;ignores Magdeburg I actually responed in that thread about Jewish Antiserbism, but it seems you fail to understand how the Jews work. Yeah, neighbors saved neighbors, because not all people were fucking redpilled on jewish threat in that period or ever. If you gave argument of Serbian armed forces saving Jews that would be something else, but mentioning civilians has absolutelly no weight. You had Germans who saved Jews, OMG NAZIS ACTUALLY LIKE JEWS BECAUSE OF SOME CIVILIANS WITH GERMAN CITIZENSHIP SAVING SOME JEWS!!! Please stop digging that hole. Because we don't have tradition of keeping our statehood alive and fighting for it, it were the Croats who led the suicide battle against the invader, always rebeling against their rulers in Vienna, having two major national uprising, uniting their slavic brethren in one country and in the end were the last European nation to stand against the ZOG in 90's! Please, pride is absent among Croats, what you display is pride is hollow and godless, it often manifests as pure hatred toward anything that is Serbian, be it a script or religion. &gt;upfront and honest Good thing you guys said you wanted independent state while Serbs were liberating our lands from Austria and forming Yugoslavia. Oh right... &gt;illusion of Power More like reality, since Serbs together with Romanians, Bulgarians and Greeks in the region, actually know what power is and how to achieve it, while Croats are always eager to suck someones dick and serve. You can mock Serbs for our Russophilia, but if you had any knowledge of history, you'd find out that most of the times we were indeed left alone and not ina single war did we asked for Russian assistance. For God's sake, we refused any help during 90's war while you were dick sucking the NATO to help our drive out some kids and farmers of your land. And the worst thing, you're not even ashemed of being pawns of ZOG during 90's war. What is there to like about Croatians anyway? What is their heroic path from fallen empire to the national rebirth and unifying their country? Where are their national heroes who confronted the great powers and gave it's people liberation? What fruits did their nation birthed and contributed to this world? Where are their myths and legends (besides King Tomislav)? Where was their heroism during the great wars? Serving their masters and putting kids in camps? 90's? Side by side with muslims fighting Christian orthodox Serbs."
"You have to strike a balance somehow. If you don't subsidize anything, the economy will grind to a halt, if you subsidize too much, you risk inflation. After getting wrecked in WW1 and looted by communists and Jews, Germany's economy got revived in half a decade, I think any apparent ""waste"" is acceptable under these circumstances. There never was and never will be a perfect economic programme, unless we develop an AI that eventually starts to learn way faster than we ever could and ultimately become capable of single-handedly running the global economy. So only shitty businesses should be nationalized to drain the State Treasury? To end up like most communist countries where the state keeps running useless factories just to keep employment close to 100% on paper? They did it in Romania, guess what, the industry went to shit."
"It's not as simple as all that, in the pseudo-Soviet system of Finland you don't even have to be registered group to be banned, they could practically try arresting people for simply the fact they form ""an ideological association"" by hanging out together. But yeah, no one here expected ZOG to simply fall over and hand over power? This is what you will have ahead of you, if you constitute an actual danger threat unlike the faux-revolutionaries and useful jew tools of the left. I felt pride as they singled us out as the only truly revolutionary organization in Finland. My educated guess is the pass won't ban since the argument seems to be mostly that NRM is directly opposed to ""accepted values"" and ""good manners"". There's no legal definition for those, of course, and can't be. When shit's that vague, you could use it just as well for us than against us. Commies and sodomites are against ""good manners"" as well, right? But then again, ZOG is ZOG, so one has to be prepared for absolutely anything."
"The problem feeds itself. Someone growing up in a world where they are not allowed to fight back will inadvertently feel even more helpless, leading to suicide feeling like the only answer. Liberalism feeds itself, it causes problems then tries to find ""solutions"" to the problems it causes. It is akin to putting your hand on a hot stove and seeing the solution to it being continuously dumping cold water on your hand, as opposed to taking your hand off."
"I meant a more liberal approach to the fascist alterntitive, not a more liberal approach to what is currently in place. Nationalising the banks and kicking out the international jewery is a better way to remove foreign influence than the tightest immigration possible."
"I won't cover anarcho-syndicalism and the particular variety of anarchism endorsed by the libertarian left, including that defined by Noam Chomsky that values possession over agreed upon property rights, but rather the type of political philosophy endorsed by the libertarian right and all of its accompanying statuettes. This is the same type of libertarianism commonly referred to as anarcho-capitalism, and endorsed, at least in part, by thinkers such as Ayn Rand, economists such as Murray Rothbard and Milton Friedman (although they possess minarchist tendencies), and the more modernly popular Stefan Molyneux. I have a few communist acquaintances, although I share little in common with them. I also have a closer white nationalist friend, whom I share quite a bit in common with, and whom introduced me to fascism as more than a demonic authoritarian evil. Regardless, I would appreciate the input of any and all who read this, as I've heard plenty of refutable arguments from leftists concerning the necessity of a state. These arguments include the need for roads (a triviality), welfare (a bane and not a boon for productive members of society), police force and public services (completely realizable by free market forces), and likewise the dissolution of the market due to infighting, theft, and violence (which dismisses itself in the presence of security firms and private defense from both individuals and businesses due to liberal gun-possession laws. Simply, the relative cost for stealing once does not even come close to equaling the risk of death in the attempt of such an action.) The most relevant argument that presents itself exists as one for the military: In a world without governments, security firms would fulfill this role with adequacy, and the chance of power consolidation from a single firm remains far-fetched due to competition that manifests in part due to the relative inefficiency of large structures and the accompanying advantages of smaller, more competitive agencies. However, in the presence of governments, there always exists the likely scenario that involves a military takeover of a region. In short, the presence of authoritarianism demands an opposing authoritarian hierarchy, such as a government, as a countermeasure against such regimes. If I had to choose either a communist regime or fascist regime, I would certainly choose a fascist regime, given that I was a member of the dominant party, or alternatively, the regime placed minimal oppression on non-majority groups. A meritocratic and minimally intrusive fascist state would be ideal, but this may not represent the idea of fascism very well. What are your thoughts on libertarian values and the absence of a state? Is it idealistic, and if so, why?"
"Someone recently mentioned Physiognomy, and the more I read about it the more I believe it is true Take a look at the faces Fascist extremists are more often good looking, confident, etc etc while antifa (the opposite of us) are generally lanky, unkempt, have weak jawlines, etc etc. It just has to do with what kind of people are attracted to what worldview, naturally superior people want to actualize their potential while progressive libtards and antifascists want to bring us all down to their level with state mandated equality, and its not a surprise women of any race are naturally attracted to the former. You are open about your beliefs?"
"The moment I heard of Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington's suicide this week I immediately thought ""liberal degeneration"", even though I didn't know much about the guy. The dude had six kids and was a successful rock-star, just like Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell who also hung himself some months back... but saw no reason to continue living. I looked up his last interview to check my assumption that he was a low-T whiny narcissistic bitch (i.e., liberal mental illness) and here are the results... Notice that nearly every second word he says is ""I... me... me... in my head... how I'm feeling..."" with constant faggy up-talk... I thought it worth noting that the emo-rock white musicians of the 90s (e.g., Kurt Cobain) found nothing worth staying alive to fight for, despite wild career success and being family men. This breed and era of 90s skinny white grunge American musician has all but died off... And I hope something more life affirming can rise to take its place. I think the takeaway from this interview is that guys like this focus on ""feeling good"" as the end in itself, whereas I think men with a sense of duty, honour, and purpose see their feelings as only one aspect of life. The higher man can tolerate suffering in the pursuit of achieving something even greater than mere ""happiness""."

One way flights to Liberia are cheap."
"The problem of WN goes a bit further than simply the difficulty of removing feminism altogether from it. The other problem is the lack of clear firm stances on miscegenation &amp; homosexuality. This I think is really dragging things down to as you say the prevalence of autistism (though it serves a purpose to aggravate the establishment and undermine liberals &amp; their narratives on social media - 4th gen memetic warfare). The other problem is the lack of a manifesto and a guide for debate to help coalesce the best elements &amp; strategies of WN together. Its essentially franchise nationalism ATM which although much more resistant to the systems attempts to sabotage it, it runs the risk of being extremely undisciplined, various factions/sides degrading into degeneracy and one ruining the reputation of the other etc. This is however in the age of the internet a necessary structure to use but it just needs to become more real-world to have impact and give opportunity to put belief into action, which will not only to serve to make it masculine tradition but it will separate the gold from the chaff so that superior individuals can serve as role models &amp; who will make the movement more clear as a result. Thus I definitely agree that the world-view and practical elements are very flawed at the moment. I feel the Alt-right in some ways has more potential to grow in traditional ways then even Fascism has due to a mass cultural shift. For instance in the creation of masculine sub-culture elements like Gym culture (strongman physique) for StrongLifts, Fight Clubs or Bare-knuckle boxing and reviving Dueling (holmgang). Which is European in origin and compatible with the spirit of Aryans - more extreme then even many of things proposed on IM. This would provide that ability for the WN to put some of its proposed principles of strength, courage, focus, self-sacrifice and honor into practice as it manifests into physical movements. The reason why its possible is because of the coalescing of oldschool WN characteristics that still understands traditionalism (e.g the 10 eternal truths) with the Mano-sphere under the Alt-right. World-view and practicality respectively converging into something better than it was individually. The natural step after that is futurism."
"So you think it should be a crime to express a certain political ideology because you don't agree with it? I don't support communism any more than you, but again, I don't believe that, even if I was in the government, I would be entitled to force others to live according to my ideology."
"Their hypocrisy, just like their open hostility towards anything white and/or masculine, is so blatant it's shameful. Yet every time a nigger commits a crime and gets wasted by the police, they whine in unison about ""media bias against pocs"" and point to the faux-rightwing shills on FOX as definitive evidence. Cultural marxists own all the levers of cultural consensus, have billions behind them and still insist that they are underdogs fighting an oppressive ""fascist"" regime. Haven't seen it, but it's about the most prolific sniper in U.S. history who shot dead hundreds of ragheads in Iraq. Liberals have been raging butthurt over it because they think it's ""fascist propaganda."" In other words, it's a war film."

"I will start off with a stark introduction of myself and later explain some my ideologies and plans. I think some of you might be keen on what I have to say, so read closely. I searched this forum and it seems there is not a lot of talk about farming and Permaculture. Anybody with common sense knows that agriculture lays out the foundation to any society or civilization. This is essentially what moved humans out of hunter-gatherer societies into domesticated environments, allowing us to advance. We all take it for granted everyday; our food source, and our farmers. Permaculture is the process of creating a self-sustainable ecosystem. Any political ideology can technically be used with it, as every type of society needs a source of food. I will explain more about Permaculture and farming later in this post. A brief explanation/history is linked below: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture I consider myself as a firm believer of Neo-Fascism and Traditionalism. Some influences of mine include Dmowski, Evola, Mussolini, and Codreanu. I am currently 18 years old and reside in the United States. I was born in Sweden to an American Father of Celtic heritage, and a Polish mother. I grew up living in Poland, Sweden, and the US (where I've spent most of my life) and speak decent Polish. Ever since I was a child, I have had a great value for European tradition, language, and history. These were things I was brought up with around my family. Like most of you on here, I am infuriated by the downfall and complete mockery of our homeland. It has been smeared by Leftist politics, multiculturalism, and Zionism. Europeans are angry and confused at this rapid change, and many people are trying to find a solution. However, let me tell you that waiting on a race war or some kind of cataclysmic event is useless, because it probably won't happen. You will be suppressed by the government and its police force. Shooting sprees and violence are also quiet obsolete, just look at people like Dylann Roof or Anders Breivik; they made absolutely no change by committing acts of violence, and now sit in prison cells for the rest of their lives. It happens so frequently now and as an individual, it is unlikely that you will implement a huge change by doing this. So what is the solution to all of this? There is none. No political solution is currently present. The odds are stacked against us, and the people with money and power glare down from their high chairs. Now I'm sure you've heard the saying, ""If you can't beat em', join em'!"". This is correct - to an extent. Try to utilize experience to help your own cause. Let me give you an example of my own life choice: I am about enlist in the United States Marine Corps. I am not doing this to fight for the interest of Israel or rich people, I am doing this for me. The military gives you skills that you will not learn anywhere else in the world. You learn self-defense, survival skills, fitness, obedience, weapons training, and achievement. As a Fascist, I believe every young man should serve in the military - it creates men. Also, if anyone here is considering joining, remember to shut the fuck up and leave your opinions at the door. The last thing you want is your nigger DI overhearing your racist bullshit when you snicker behind his back - you WILL be kicked out for racism. Tattoos are another thing. If you enter with some kind of totenkopf or pagan tattoo, they will classify you as a gang member. Neo-Nazis in Iraq and Afghanistan would go on civilian shooting sprees and the military eventually caught on to this. They will identify you with any type of symbolism you put out. Don't blow it, just put in your 4 years and get it over with. Even if you are not joining the military, work on yourself. Practice what you preach. Fascism and National Socialism are aimed at creating positive and strong men and women. If you claim these ideologies, then act like it. Wear presentable clothing, get a nice haircut, and stop fucking wasting all your time on the internet. Go out on jogs and hikes. Go to the gym. Go enjoy nature, and learn new skills. Cut all the degeneracy from your life. Stop watching pornography, stop smoking and drinking so frequently, and stay away from drugs and degenerate people. Also remember, National Socialism and Fascism are not about hate - it is about strength, confidence and superiority. Hate consumes all your energy and drags you into a pit of nihilism and depression. I've been there. We all don't like niggers and minorities, but they aren't leaving anytime soon. Stop focusing on them and focus on yourself. Separate yourself from the noise. Like I said before, hurting/killing them will not do anything. Back to the topic of Goals/Agriculture, after my service I plan to move to Poland. I will probably do a few years of university there. I have plans with a few friends to build a homestead and to start Permaculture on the property. Permaculture at first starts off small. You can start to grow basic fruits and vegetables like berries, potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and cucumbers. If you have success with this, then add to the picture. Grow bigger plants, and get livestock like chickens, pigs, and cows. Start to raise your own ecosystem and become self-sustainable. Also, and I cant stress this enough, put everything to use. Don't waste things. In the video below, Varg Vikernes gives some examples: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZY5yR6NZ8A Varg might be crazy, but he's not stupid. He actually practices Permaculture himself with his family. Some of his videos give tips on living an Off-The-Grid lifestyle. There is always much to learn about agriculture. Go to farms and ask questions, search the web, always strive to learn something new. The internet always has good sources. This link provides the ""12 Principles of Permaculture"". It shows the original design principles of Permaculture. These methods should be applied when developing your ecosystem - it will help you become more self reliant. https://justlists.wordpress.com/2010/01/14/principles-of-permaculture/ When it came to agriculture and supplies, our ancestors always worked hard and prepared for the future, and so should you. Always be ready for any outcome. You never know when something could go wrong, so plan in advance and store things that could come in use. Storing items very important, as it can serve you in a time of need. Store things like: Water, Foods that don't expire, Toilet paper, Ammo and Weapons, Wood, Gas, Matches/Lighters, Blankets, Warm Clothes, Tools for grooming, and First-Aid. These are necessities that we take for granted everyday. Always have an abundant supply of them. Believe it or not, but ""Survivalism"" and ""Prepping"" are becoming popular. Due to all the global stress lately, people want to prepare for the worst. With all the tensions in Poland with the EU, Ukraine, and Russia, many people have started to engage in these lifestyles. Paramilitary and Militia groups have also been growing: http://www.dw.com/en/paramilitary-groups-ready-to-defend-poland/a-19325101 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob4eh7d_Kys http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-poland-militias-idUSKBN0MG24I20150320 These actions have been recently supported in Poland, and while there are strict gun regulations, people who can prove responsibility can obtain them. I actually know quiet a bit of Poles who own firearms. I have a few friends who are in Straż Graniczna (Border Guards), and we plan to start training together, and to start training others as well. I know a few people in the US Military who plan to also train people in Europe after their service. As Europeans, we must retake our homeland, not with the offensive, but with the defensive. Forming a Paramilitary is a great idea, and can be synonymous with living with an OTG lifestyle. This is why Military experience can be so useful. All these things can contribute to a self-sustainable lifestyle, and it can all be done legally. Its a Europeans duty to protect his people and culture. One day, its possible that an opportunity could appear for us to put this into practice. Lets use our time wisely to work on ourselves, and to help our fellow Europeans. Thank you for reading. I hope to meet new people on here with similar views."
capitalism in these day=kikes. Capitalism is an emanation of the jewish type of humanity and anyone who actively engage in that process is serving the Jewish type of humanity and even being judaized himself.
"Capitalism is based on a model of exploitation, which with the industrialization developed into modern capitalism, but is present since the dawn of man (slave and slaveholder, servant and feodal lord, worker and capitalist). A capitalist society is a class society, which creates conflicts because of conflicting interests and exploitation between the social classes. The bourgeois French revolution is only one stage in this history and a fine example of class conflict that errupted before Marx was even born. Therefore Capitalism stands in the way of the harmony system that fascism promotes, which is based on the ethical socialist idea of social justice. Class war, class struggle and class conflict pre-date Marxism and outbursts of socialism exist since class society (thus capitalism) exists. Well a lot of early (proto-)Fascist manifesto´s seem to agree with me. Also I get most of my ideas not from Marx but rather from the godfather of Fascism: Georges Sorel. The liberal revolution would only be one example of class conflict, its simply a dialectic process (thesis and antithesis) that repeats and develops itself throughout human history. This exploitative relation predates liberalism and lays at the fundamental basis of the French revolution and rise of liberalism. But instead of a socialist revolt the French revolution simply led to the introduction of a new ruling class: the aristocracy was replaced by the bourgeoisie. So liberalism was a consequence of pre-Marxist class struggle. It didn't result in freedom for all social classes, but only led to a new class coming to power: the rise of a new capitalist class. So from this we can conclude that you're incorrect, because class struggle existed long before (hundreds of years) Marx even started to develop his theory. So its a age old consequence of class division and exploitation and not a invention of communists - historic socialism is the uprise of a class to protect its interests. Fascism wants to get rid of these conflicting class interests by creating a harmonious system of social justice in which social classes are abolished in favor of the organic society. Its simply a alternative way to realize - in a broad sense - the same as Marx wanted to create: a harmonious society of class unity. Fascists replaced Marx ""dictatorship of the proletariat"" with the ""people-community"" (volksgemeinschaft) or ""nation"", to achieve the same: class harmony. They also rejected Marx his scientific idea that socialism was a consequense of capitalism and that the proletarian class was moved only by materialist interests, and adopted Hendrik de Man his psychological idea that socialism came from human ethics and that classes fought out of selfrespect, aswell as Sorel his utopian interpretation that the classes where moved by revolutionary myths, rather then materialist interests: ""the masses need to believe"". I think one would hardly define Fascist economy amd its dirigism as a free market system, the only ones claiming this would be antifascists. Ofcourse it wasn't a soviet style planeconomy either, but the same goes for pretty many nations that knew socialist manifestations, even Marxism comes in all kind of different flavours (orthodoxy, revisionism, social-democracy, communism). So again its not much of a argument... And South Korea is a sattelite state for Western interests, so what is your point? They adapted consumerculture and all the filth that comes with this. Many post-war German communists where usually strongly opposed against all foreign domination (US and Soviet) and propagated a strong re-united nationalist German state. And even today we see that its especially in Eastern Germany (former DDR) where the nationalist movement and German traditions still live in contrast to Western Germany (BRD). Stating that Marxists are opposed against imperialism is also wrong, considering constructs such as the USSR existed out of several nations and etnicities, and certainly would qualify as imperialist (ofcourse by some justified as ""liberation"" or ""revolutionary necessity""). But on the other hand so did Fascist Italy, that was also divided and hardly qualified as a nation before Mussolini his march on Rome: it was united by a nationalist myth rather then concrete history. So its not so black and white as some here would like to see it. National-Syndicalist..."

"Exactly, if you're in hooligan or neo-NS scene you encounter police repression every few weeks, you get beaten like an animal, you get framed, illegal house searches etc. and nobody whines about it 1% as much as these libertarians and leftists. Just shows you how much they're part of the system. If you're doing something that is against the system or against social norms deep down you'll accept such behaviour of the cops who are defending the system. It's wrong but there's no reason to be shocked about it or play the victim all over media. There's also no reason to defend the cops either, beating their own people for a lousy wage."
"How exactly? My understanding of moral relativism is that it is simply an understanding of how environment affects personal philosophy, to say there is an inherent moral code which is universal among humans is delusional. Where it becomes a problem is when liberals seek to use moral relativism to justify behaviour adverse to our society's own moral code (which itself is relative)."

"And I gotta say: A Canadian who wants a NA Union? You are the type of scum that fascists should be fighting against. You're NA Union ideals are the same as those of the Liberals and the Conservatives - the very threats that are facing this country. Canada is English and French - get used to it. It seems like the sovereigntists either want independence, or want the very Nation of Canada dissolved. In any case, anybody that promotes the elimination of the Nation is anti-nationalist and therefore anti-fascist."
"He didn't say that, did he? Socialism means organizing, nothing more. National Socialism = Organized Nationalism. It does not imply state ownership of the means of production, nor did it, in the Nazis definition, imply confiscation of private property. City streets and general-access highways could be provided by private voluntary exchange, the costs being paid for by charging tolls. But the costs of collecting the tolls would often be very large compared to the cost of building and maintaining the streets or highways and the tolls often cause back logs. This is where ""socialism"" comes in handy, the benefits are in favour for it. Airports are another example, along with harbors, national defense and law enforcement. Socialism is a crap term to use, I never use it because leftists, semantic word players and pretentious faggots have a monopoly on the word and it causes confusion. Welcome to the forum, CommieKiller."
"Ramiro broke with JosÃ© and formed his own little leftist circlejerk and got shot. The end.

Neither of them ever supported ""National Bolshevism"", either. /sperg rekt"
"Well, number 1, you're forgetting the Eastern Orthodox church. Catholics have had a huge historical conflict with the Orthodox church ever since the schism back in I believe 1054 A.D. Catholics are the most traditional form of Christianity out of the three sects, Orthodox Christians split from the church because the archbishop of Constantinople (also the emperor of the Byzantine Empire), was butthurt about not being pope. The Protestants broke off because they were butthurt about all of the corruption and stupid strict laws in Catholicism. I'm a Catholic, so I will always support Catholicism. Naturally, Catholicism today is weak, and Liberal. They need a return to the old days, anti-kike, anti-Muslim, etc. However, the great cathedrals of the Catholic faith will always look much more grand than those of Protestant or Orthodox build (exception being the Hagia Sophia)."

"How about you follow all that shit up with 'because' eh? So far you're giving me a load of lame opinions that I don't recall asking for- I already know your opinions, reiterating them a million times won't make them any more right. I read fine last time, now EXPLAIN otherwise it isn't a debate. You know, something about the US doesn't exactly phase me as racist... couldn't have a clue what, I'm just not feeling it. Maybe you can help me out? Same for all the others, don't make me fucking laugh, they take the slightest shred of common sense to refute- America, militarist? Masculine? oh lawd. If America was half the nationalist state that Israel most certainly is, the world would be ten times a better place for all white people in general. If you want me to spell this shit out for you, I can, I just think it so blatantly obvious that there is no need. is there? Depends. Fascism has only one critical component that if removed, would no longer make it fascism: national pride, transcendental revolutionary national spirit and awareness. As long as this lives well in an ideology, all its other components are pure functionalities and fall into place by themselves. As long as they all work (which is a complex thing in itself) they all generally gravitate around having effective state support for the national spirit, which is very present in Israel, making it proto-fascist in my eyes. It's similar to actual fascism, and while it doesn't follow the same doctrine as the original fascist movement in Italy, none of the movements which followed the Italian had the same or even a remotely similar doctrine. Were they all also pseudo in your eyes? hah! The government's continuity never ended- Hitler used powers constitutionally and democratically granted to him to end the Republic, therefore while the Weimar government was dissolved, Hitler never overthrew it. Those are DIFFERENT things, and don't derail the topic. Its also a damned shame that I have to explain to you that western values aren't capitalism and liberalism, myself not even being a western man. Says enough for you implying that someone else's commentary on a country actually speaks for it, but imagine for a moment that they're right. To you western values apparently means liberal model, which I fucking laugh at, because it completely throws out the principle of cultural nationalism, and assumes that whatever arbitrary agenda a modern government has actually speaks entirely for the roots and heritage of an entire people. What that means is that apparently to you, western values isn't the culmination of centuries' cultural and spiritual evolution, revolution, war and blood, but whatever latest fetish government bureaucrats have come up with. Liberalism isn't a western value, it's an anti-value, it doesn't hold any grounds in the actual nations of the west, it's in fact the poison that is murdering them. Such isn't the case for Israel, which is conscious and well aware of itself as a nation and actively fighting to protect and develop this heritage, this state of mind. I don't believe fascism is inherently socialistic. I would prefer such a version of it, but you can absolutely have one without the either. Fascism doesn't equal socialism, since economic forms like that are purely utilities: they always vary when applied in each different nation, and they don't really matter in regards to the actual principles of fascism because socialism, capitalism and third positionism are all just utilities, tools essentially. Fascism ideologically gravitates toward the corporatist third positionism, which is straight down the middle between left and right. It can go in either direction, and generally varies when applied in different countries. Russian fascism would be very socialistic, American fascism would be very capitalistic. This isn't so much because of historical tradition, but the national spirit that made these systems happen so effectively in each nation- the latter actually underlies the former. The reason both countries have histories involving those specific systems is because they are ideal for the sort of people in those nations. However, both systems could be fascistic if fused with a state nationalism, as aforementioned. lol, oh my god. That was metaphorical: avant-garde is an artistic style, modernist and left wing but still used for fascism, making it the example for why things like this are totally arbitrary in a fascist state and varies entirely with the whims of the people who control said state, and the type of people they govern. Honestly, just admit you don't even know what we're talking about here and we'll leave it at that."
"You'll need to explain this, because I don't understand what you mean. They were revolutionaries, they intended to sabotage the current order to create a new one. That's what we are, member? The Francoists wanted to preserve the backward, counter-productive and exploitive order and had no redeeming qualities, other than them being supposedly on the ""cultural right,"" which is debatable anyway. Both sides were equally bloody- it was a brutal war. You rightly noticed that these killings weren't done out of idealism but for logical materialist reasons. The social classes were rigidly divided for decades by then, and in a brother-shot-brother struggle. The only response that was feasable and practical were repression, and this applied to both sides. Oh puhlease, you act as though the Francoists weren't capitalist anti-fascists. Franco literally repressed the falange, and later betrayed every single one of their ideas during his reign. The conservatives definitely qualify as anti-fascists in my book, not the pinko fag kind that dominate our stereotype of them, but a useful idiot to serve the interests of the old nobility and later, the capitalists. I would've fought for the republicans because they had at least some merit to them, This is true, and a major flaw of the republican movement, and likely why it failed. We're not talking in terms of realism of course- now, with historical perspective, we all know they will fail, and why they will fail. I'm saying that, were I there (which in itself is of course impossible) I would've fought on their side, because I liked their ideas. Sure, the Francoists were more culturally right wing, much more- they stood for the crumbling and failing institutions of the old order, mostly, because they believed in nothing else. You definitely can't call them nationalists or fascists: they're the same sort of nationalists that American libertarians are and Russian monarchists were. They like the system, the facade because this is the side their bread is buttered on. They do not love the true nation beneath it."
"That's exactly it. We have the same here. For example, one of the people that we see as the father of our ideals was accused by both liberals and religious fundamentalists as not being of our race, simply because of the geography he lived in was surrendered in mind to those of the other race, that we consider to be ""animalistic"". They called out to this in order to deprive us of pride and of any shred of ""nationalism"" that was preached by a man who was not even of our kin, supposedly. The interracial porn and the advocation of interracial relationships is used by liberals to break the morale and spirit of the opposition. Whether they themselves are racists or not...Well, I cannot say, racist against the whites in the US, or the majority ethnicity in every country they are, they support minorities, intermarriages that distort national consciousness, and of course the destruction of the majority identity. I personally think that this is mostly not because they themselves are racists-its more because they are mongrels. I have seen a lot of people here that have opposed me when I spoke of the evils of intermarriage and how it is an affront to our national identity, and later on in the conversation, I have learned that they themselves are the products of heavy mongrelization. They simply are unable to understand the point of keeping an ethnicity pure of blood and mind, because they themselves are riddled with questions in their mongrel mind. These are beyond saving, especially those who share the consciousness of more than two ethnicities. So I would not accuse them of deliberately being racist, because they themselves have no race to become racists."
"May I add that it will not improve much without some sort of separation movement. The main reason for this is our national history. These people, in particular blacks, will not serve and protect a country that they were told oppressed their ancestors. I could understand that. The problem is they want to have their cake and eat it too. They will be damned if we cut entitlement programs, and assistance to their communities. I read the manifesto of the Black Panther Party from the 1960s, the first few points were reasonable; such as ending the interference of the white man in black people's lives and, from what I can gather, education for black people by black people. Then as you go down the list; Oh yeah, and free food, housing, land, employment, schooling, exemptions from military service, exemptions from laws... what an asinine organization that was."
"There are actually 22 degrees. Also, if you are going to condemn me, then do it. I will not beg for mercy. Though it is funny that that you allow Marxists and race traitors though, but won't allow the truly repentant."
"We need intellectuals, sadly. What we don't need are a bunch of damn Communists running around trying to make everybody suffer for a flawed political system. But hey, we could always use a different perspective around here. I suspect most of the people here are getting lazy, what with proving themselves right all the time."
"http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/03/19/bloomberg-strikes-again-nyc-bans-food-donations-to-the-homeless/ &gt;NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) â€” Mayor Michael Bloombergâ€™s food police have struck again! &gt;Outlawed are food donations to homeless shelters because the city canâ€™t assess their salt, fat and fiber content, reports CBS 2â€™s Marcia Kramer. &gt;Glenn Richter arrived at a West Side synagogue on Monday to collect surplus bagels â€” fresh nutritious bagels â€” to donate to the poor. However, under a new edict from Bloombergâ€™s food police he can no longer donate the food to city homeless shelters. &gt;Itâ€™s the â€œno bagels for youâ€ edict. &gt;â€œI canâ€™t give you something thatâ€™s a supplement to the food you already have? Sorry thatâ€™s wrong,â€ Richter said. &gt;Richter has been collecting food from places like the Ohav Zedek synagogue and bringing it to homeless shelters for more than 20 years, but recently his donation, including a â€œcholentâ€ or carrot stew, was turned away because the Bloomberg administration wants to monitor the salt, fat and fiber eaten by the homeless. &gt;Richter said he was stunned. He said his family has eaten the same food forever and flourished. &gt;â€œMy father lived to 97; my grandfather lived to 97, and they all enjoyed it and somehow weâ€™re being told that this is no good and I think there is a degree of management that becomes micromanagement and when you cross that line simply what youâ€™re doing is wrong,â€ Richter said. what a fucking pinko."
"I don't blame the Muslims. This movement is middle class, spineless, holier-than-thou whites who think they know so well the difference between ""moderate Islam"" (people who wear the attire but where conflicts arise between Islamic doctrine and neoliberalism side with liberalism) and ""radical Islam"" (people who follow aspects of Islam they don't like). It's not even for the benefits of Muslims who might get hurt feelings on public transit it's just so that these leftists can feel good about themselves. It just illustrates how far things have progressed to where people's first response has become #notALLmuslims instead of anger at being taken advantage of in your own country."
"Yeah because I was totally on about current Christianity being deserving of respect I have yet to see a single convincing argument from atheists against religion that isn't rooted in materialistic/liberal ""morality"". Might is Right is most likely satire and in any case it oversimplifies the original Christian teachings; I've pointed out time and time again that there is no pacifism in the bible. You'll also find MiR has more of a pagan ring to it than an atheistic one if you've ever read past the first 4 pages."

"The only thing that makes me skeptical of this book besides the fact that I first heard about it on SF, is that it's never clear in who's going to be doing the shooting (besides rebellious whites).

And i find it hard to believe the browns can form a stable, functioning army- that's what the crime waves and the occasional cartel operations are for, already. That only leaves the treasonous U.S military...er i mean the treasonous U.S smart drones."

"Saw something pop up about this on Facebook a while ago. The guy is Romanian. I think he's pentecostal.

"Cosmic order is based on race and soul, it requires one to be both deserving and conscious of their place. We don't value every single white person, because most white people are lost and therefore do not actively observe their role in the cosmic order. This is heresy, if you want to look at it that way. We value a fascist non-white comrade more than we do, for instance, a rabid and stupid white liberal. However, race-mixing is haram; there's no excuse for it. Race is the foundation, the soul decides whether you actually decide to build on that foundation."

You're basically using leftist terminology."
"He the Negro is but a grown up child, and must be governed as a child, not as a lunatic or criminal. The master occupies toward him the place of parent or guardian. We shall not dwell on this view, for no one will differ with us who thinks as we do of the negro's capacity, and we might argue till dooms-day in vain, with those who have a high opinion of the negro's moral and intellectual capacity. Secondly. The negro is improvident; will not lay up in summer for the wants of winter; will not accumulate in youth for the exigencies of age. He would become an insufferable burden to society. Society has the right to prevent this, and can only do so by subjecting him to domestic slavery. In the last place, the negro race is inferior to the white race, and living in their midst, they would be far outstripped or outwitted in the chaos of free competition. Gradual but certain extermination would be their fate. We presume the maddest abolitionist does not think the negro's providence of habits and money-making capacity at all to compare to those of the whites. This defect of character would alone justify enslaving him, if he is to remain here. In Africa or the West Indies, he would become idolatrous, savage and cannibal, or be devoured by savages and cannibals. At the North he would freeze or starve. We would remind those who deprecate and sympathize with negro slavery, that his slavery here relieves him from a far more cruel slavery in Africa, or from idolatry and cannibalism, and every brutal vice and crime that can disgrace humanity; and that it christianizes, protects, supports and civilizes him; that it governs him far better than free laborers at the North are governed. There, wife-murder has become a mere holiday pastime; and where so many wives are murdered, almost all must be brutally treated. Nay, more; men who kill their wives or treat them brutally, must be ready for all kinds of crime, and the calendar of crime at the North proves the inference to be correct. Negroes never kill their wives. If it be objected that legally they have no wives, then we reply, that in an experience of more than forty years, we never yet heard of a negro man killing a negro woman. Our negroes are not only better off as to physical comfort than free laborers, but their moral condition is better. The negro slaves of the South are the happiest, and, in some sense, the freest people in the world. The children and the aged and infirm work not at all, and yet have all the comforts and necessaries of life provided for them. They enjoy liberty, because they are oppressed neither by care nor labor. The women do little hard work, and are protected from the despotism of their husbands by their masters. The negro men and stout boys work, on the average, in good weather, not more than nine hours a day. The balance of their time is spent in perfect abandon. Besides' they have their Sabbaths and holidays. White men, with so much of license and liberty, would die of ennui; but negroes luxuriate in corporeal and mental repose. With their faces upturned to the sun, they can sleep at any hour; and quiet sleep is the greatest of human enjoyments. ""Blessed be the man who invented sleep."" 'Tis happiness in itself--and results from contentment with the present, and confident assurance of the future. A common charge preferred against slavery is, that it induces idleness with the masters. The trouble, care and labor, of providing for wife, children and slaves, and of properly governing and administering the whole affairs of the farm, is usually borne on small estates by the master. On larger ones, he is aided by an overseer or manager. If they do their duty, their time is fully occupied. If they do not, the estate goes to ruin. The mistress, on Southern farms, is usually more busily, usefully and benevolently occupied than any one on the farm. She unites in her person, the offices of wife, mother, mistress, housekeeper, and sister of charity. And she fulfills all these offices admirably well. The rich men, in free society, may, if they please, lounge about town, visit clubs, attend the theatre, and have no other trouble than that of collecting rents, interest and dividends of stock. In a well constituted slave society, there should be no idlers. But we cannot divine how the capitalists in free society are to put to work. The master labors for the slave, they exchange industrial value. But the capitalist, living on his income, gives nothing to his subjects. He lives by mere exploitations. Let's not forget that the African tribes and chiefs played a part in selling their own people, and other tribal peoples into slavery, which can be explained in this excerpt from the University of Heidelberg: When Europeans first came to Africa in search of slaves, the African leaders themselves were eager to contribute. Initially, the slaves were war prisoners, criminals or people in debt. However, as the European demand for slaves grew, African leaders turned to new ways to find slaves. Wars were started for the sole reasons of taking prisoners to sell, and many were simply kidnapped (either by people from their own tribe, or from competing tribes). Some African rulers earned great profits by controlling the regional slave trade."
"this is nothing new. What you have to realize is that it isn't the fault of your liberal bogeyman government; it's the fault of the American people, for being indecisive and democratic. The fault isn't that the government placed some stigma against fascism, this was done by a cultural agent that was universally recognized by conservatives as cancer, but who chose the same democratic voter's route and every time it failed them. That is because no fascist government exercised the sort of deliberate social programming and control that modern liberal governments have over their citizens. The characterization of 'fascism' if it means statism is completely correct. The real fascism, which is racial and religious in nature cannot be mistaken for the present system. bro, define fascism. oh no, people lied about me what am I going to do!? No one should be surprised by this; these people are our enemies and they hate us. Being lied about kinda came with the politics. Once you actually get serious you will probably see other things happen to you as well. Don't complain about it, wear your banner proudly."
